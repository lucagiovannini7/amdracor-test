     A BIT OF INSTRUCTION
    </head>
    <p>
     Was first produced by Mr. Henry Woodruff, at a special performance at Brattee Hall, Cambridge, on February 25, 1898. On this occasion, Mr. Woodruff appeared as " Despard "; and Mr. Harry Gay as " Newbury ."
    </p>
    <p>
     The play was given by Mr. Woodruff, at the Lyceum Theatre, New York, on April 22, 1898. Mr. Woodruff then played " Newbury ," and Mr. Robert Edeson was the " Despard ."
    </p>
    <p>
     The play was used by Mr. Woodruff professionally for an extended vaudeville tour, in the autumn of 1898.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time is the present. The scene is the bachelor apartment of Jack Despard. The time is half-past twelve, of a mid-winter night.

    The scene is the bachelor sitting-room, of Jack Despard's lodgings. It is comfortably, even luxuriously furnished, in the manner of a bachelor's "den." There is a large divan, with cushions: a fireplace, R., with a bright fire: — low bookcases, well filled: lounging-chairs: — a table strewn with magazines, etc. The walls are hung with water-color sketches, pipe racks, etc. As the curtain rises, Newbury is discovered, asleep in a large arm-chair, before the fire. The chair is partly concealed from any one entering, by a screen. After a second's pause, Jack enters. He comes in, somewhat wearily. He wears a handsome, fur-lined coat. He does not see Newbury: his attention being concentrated on the fact that, in addition to the lamp, three gas-jets are in full flame .

     Do you know any fellows who like working double time? If you do, I'll bet a tenner they're not in our line of work.

   <sp who="#mertounnewbury">

     Well, but aren't the matinees the really interesting days? Fancy playing to an audience of adorers.

   </sp>
   <sp who="#jackdespard">
    <speaker>
     Jack

    </speaker>
    <p>
     If they're adorers, they conceal it skillfully. I'd about as soon start out with Nansen, in search of a chill, as play to a matinee audience.

     Bosh! When the papers get out of sea-serpent specials they write up matinee letters. They're a myth, mostly; though now and then —

     Well, now and then a fellow gets a letter that he'd like to enclose to a girl's mother, with a manual on "The Duties of Parents."

   </sp>
   <sp who="#mertounnewbury">
    <speaker>

     How else would you treat a man who, on the strength of a Club introduction, wheels himself, uninvited, into your rooms, at midnight, — asks you whether your name is not an alias, — suggests that you can't make your hands keep your head, — winds up by inviting you to turn over to a parcel of Club loungers the confidence a silly girl or two have put in your decency?

     Why, man, you
     must
     have seen her. She's at every last matinee you play. She's the little girl with the yellow hair and the big blue eyes: — she's only eighteen; — she always has a bunch of violets pinned to her seal-skin muff; — she's always eating sugared things, out of a silver filigree box. Why, do you mean to say —

     She told my sister Kit about it. Kit told me. She's no sneak, Kit; she's an awfully good sort; but she's older than Ethel; and she was scared blue when Ethel told her she'd sent that letter. You know, old chap, there are actors — that —
