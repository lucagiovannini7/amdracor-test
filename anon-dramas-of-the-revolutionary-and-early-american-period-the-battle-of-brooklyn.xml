       from C[illeg.]ar's house, till you come to Brewer's mills,
       one hundred and nine horned, and twenty-eight beasts
       of burthen, were all I could collect: nor was there compassion
       in my soul, to spare one of the kine for milk,

       in ordering that road to be flanked with breast-works,

       and precision, has reconnoitered their numbers.
       <pb n="13"/>
       which he finds to be about seven thousand. General
       Sullivan has appointed the hill with exquisite judgment;
       where the Brigades under him and Lord Stirling, are
       to take cost, and act as occasion may require: twelve
       thousand men are allotted for the service of sending
       them back to their ships. I, with eight thousand, will
       stay within these lines, to be called out to the slaughter
       and pursuit; unless our present deliberations, alter this

       fustian, a little sober reasoning, General Sullivan,
       may fit the mind for the doubtful events of war. My
       apprehensions from the King's troops, believe me, are
       trifling, compared with the risque we run, from the
       people of America at large. The tyranny, that our accursed
       usurpation has made necessary, which they now
       feel, and feeling, I fear, will soon make them see thro'
       the disguise. Their rage, no doubt, will be heightened,

       My dear General, the moments for reflection
       are elapsed, and irrecoverable, Our safety is first in
       conquest; if that is denied to our endeavours, I am
       sure, we can obtain better terms, from our much injured
       Sovereigns, than from our more injured country:
       — but wear a less useful countenance; it is a proverb
       among the troops, that their General is much melted
       down, since the fleet arrived.

       Our soldiers are a standing miracle to me:
       they define sensibly upon matters that are unimportant
       to them, and resign their powers of thinking to us, in
       a case where their all is at stake; and do not yet discover,
       that we make them the engines of our power, at
       the expence of all that is dear and sacred to them as
       men! — but avaunt reflection! Our hope, my dear Sullivan,
       is in you; every command of ground is ours, with
       <pb n="15"/>
       a perfect knowledge of all the woods and defiles: these
       advantages, at the least, double the strength of our men;
       and if we cannot defend these, I know of no place we

       True, good Sir: and I laugh to think, that
       when we have established our power, and driven these
       Red-coats into the sea, what ripping reformation you
       Gentlemen will make in church affairs. Down goes
       Episcopacy and Quakerism, at least: I hope you won't
       leave one broad-brim on the continent.

       Why really, General, we shall be very apt to
       make free with those Gentlemen. We have long beheld,
       with a jealous eye, the growing power of the Episcopal
       Clergy; and considered them as the only obstacle
       <pb n="16"/>
       so our becoming the heads of the Church, in America;
       a dignity, that so properly belongs to the Elect, and
       for which, they have had the assurance to contend with
       the Lord's own people. As for the Quakers, who in
       general have joined the tories against us, we shall not
       fail to produce "an ancient testimony" in their behalf:
       I mean the testimony of our forefathers; till with fines,
       whipping, imprisonment, and the gallows, we have
       extirpated them from the face of the earth.

       to them, it is but cooking up some new-fangled
       oath, which their squeamish consciences won't let them
       swallow; then, whip go their estates, like a juggler's

       Noah, I congratulate you, on your safe arrival into
       your old quarters; neither hol'd by musquet balls. nor
       swelled up with salt-water and creek mud. Thanks
       <pb n="25"/>
       to my activity, that I am not crab's meat with the
       rost.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome, Joe; dripping from the creek, I see: but
       I am glad to see you alive!

       some doubts about it.

       Why, man, look about you; and you will
       find this to be the very room, that we have inhabited,
       for some time past.

       My senses, good Noah, claim convictions
       something, first, to cherish me, and then I may be convinced,
       that I can, with propriety, talk upon sublunary
       subjects.

       Now I return your congratulations
       and am heartily glad to send you on this side of the
       grave — — but, Noah, what has become of our Generals?

     </sp>
     <sp who="#noah">
      <speaker>
       No.
      </speaker>

       Killed or taken prisoners; but I suppose the
       latter. — — My poor General, I quite lament him.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#joeking">
      <speaker>
       King.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       Mine is under the same predicament, but I
       have not a pity for him: — nor should I love you very
       much, if I thought you serious in your lamentation.

       Consider; he and I were brought up together:
       we went together to sea, before the mast; and since he
       commenced lawyer, he maintained a suit for me against
       my mother, and got the cause.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#joeking">
      <speaker>
       King.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       Confound the dog! But was he really a
       lawyer, and did he influence you, to commence an
       action against your mother?
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#noah">
      <speaker>
       No.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       He! — why, that fellow, drank slip every night
       with the common people of our town of Berwick, and
       had art enough, to influence them to all his ends.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#joeking">
      <speaker>
       King.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       And some hundreds of the common people,
       has he influenced to their end, this day. — — But, for
       <pb n="26"/>
       God's sake, Noah, how came a man of your understanding,
       in the capacity of this fellow's servant?
      </p>

       No.

       Without doubt, I might have started with a
       regiment, and probably, have been, myself, a general
       by this time. But I saw through their topsy turvy
       schemes; — — though I was obliged to float with the
       tide, I knew, the post of honour, would be the most
       private station. But Sullivan will be a loss to his family.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#joeking">
      <speaker>
       King.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       So will not Stirling. He will be a loss to
       no body, but those that find him. Had Sullivan any
       property?
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#noah">
      <speaker>
       No.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       Most excellent property, for he made a property
       of weakness and ignorance, and consequently
       had an extensive fund. — — But your's was a titled general,
       and I suppose very full of property; as he has
       often declared, he was of principle.
      </p>
     </sp>
     <sp who="#joeking">
      <speaker>

      </speaker>
      <p>
       His principle, Noah, has for years past, been
       to withhold other people's property from them; and
       when all the resources of art failed, his estate was exposed
       to sale by virtue of an execution: But he resisted
       the Sheriff, and declared himself a partizan of confusion,
       because law and order, would compel him to acts of
       justice. — — But, do you recollect, that this is the
       fast day?
      </p>

       Is it, really! then it is one of the baits, which
       the Continental Congress threw out, for the people of
       America to bite at; and the event gives the lie to the
       inflaming and prophetic oratory, this day resounded
       from the pulpits of New-England. A day, on which,
       heaven his discarded them, and disavowed their cause,
       in a remarkable manner. O King, our preachers prevented
       this unhappy dispute, from coming to a bloodless
       issue.

       It is a maxim with the Congress at Philadelphia,
       that by the marvellous, the vulgar are to be robb'd
       of their reason; but heaven has rejected the sacrifice,
       that the people may open their eyes, and be no longer
       the dupes of their tyranny, deception and bloodshed.

       From the first meeting of that
       Hydra
       at Philadelphia,
       it's sixty four months, have all been open to
       devour two strangers!

      <p>
       True, very true — — strangers, indeed, to
       most of them: the first they have amply usurped from
       the people, and have had art enough, to make use of
       them as instruments, to confirm the usurpation.

       They are, indeed, such monopolizers of liberty,
       that they do not suffer other people to follow their
       inclinations: but as we know, and consequently detest,
       their machinations; let us avail ourselves of the character
       of servants, and the confusion of retreat, to lie
       concealed, until they are clear of the island.

       Agreed; and in order that we may claim the
       mercy, that our good old master has extended to his
       erring servants, and return to that authority which never
       oppressed a subject; let us renew our allegiance to the
       most amiable and virtuous Prince, that ever sway'd a
       sceptre; and join our weak endeavours, in supporting
       a constitution, that has been, at once, the envy and admiration
       of the whole world.

       I honour your sentiments, because I, experimentally,
       know them to be just. And O! almighty
       disposer of human events, open the eyes of my deluded
       fellow-subjects, in this, once, happy country: encourage
       them to a free exercise of that reason, which is the
       portion of every individual, that each may judge for
       himself: then peace and order, will smile triumphant,
       over the rugged face of war and horror: the same hand
       that sows, shall reap the field; and our vines and vinyards
       be our own.
