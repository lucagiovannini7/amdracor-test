An' it's Kathleen this, an' Kathleen that, and won't ye jist run up the shtairs, Kathleen, an' come down agin, till me fate are ready to dhrop off av me entirely. An' all the toime they doin' nothing but wearin' foine clothes, and paradin' out around so's the young college fellers'll take notice. An' me driv to death waitin' on them to earn the little bit that Oi have to live on. Sure, Oi'll get aven wid 'em some foine day for all the exthra trouble they're always makin' me. What's this? Miss Dorothy's new bonnet, Oi do belave, left layin' on the chair so careless loike.
     <stage>
      ( Tries it on .)

     Faith, but I think that must look foine. An' here's one of them feather bo-eys, too. Ain't that ilegant, now?

    <p>
     Dear me, but that was a narrow escape! Whew! Just think of running into Judkins when I was flying from the kitchen with these things for our spread. She'd have asked some rather embarrassing questions, I fear. Now I believe I'll put my things on, and go down the street to meet Mildred, so she won't come in the front way, and get caught. Where's my hat? —
     <stage>
      ( Searches .)
     </stage>
     <pb n="6"/>
     That's queer! I left it right here when I went downstairs. Well, probably one of the girls has it on. They don't seem to know how to discriminate between their clothes and mine, anyway.

     DOROTHY.
    </speaker>
    <p>
     Well, I had a time. I went bravely down to the kitchen, and stole them, absolutely stole them, which was a perfect miracle, for the cook was right there. And when I was coming back with them, I met Judkins coming right down the hall.

     Yes, and she drew herself up and said in her most majestic tones (that always reminds me of the time she found us on the annex roof,) "My dear Miss Talcott I wish to speak to you a moment.

     ALICE.

    <p>
     You brave girl! — Well, I think we'd better get our books out where we can grab them in case of an emergency. Better have her come now than later, when the boys are here.

   </sp>
   <sp who="#dorothy">
    <speaker>
     DOROTHY.
    </speaker>
    <p>
     Oh, yes, much better. I do hope Mildred won't get caught. You know she went down town to invest in some things for our spread, and now that Judkins has one little suspicion, she will keep her eagle eye out for more evidence. You know, it absolutely makes me shudder, that eye of Judkins's. By the way, Alice, have you seen my new hat anywhere?
    </p>
   </sp>
   <sp who="#alice">
    <speaker>
     ALICE.

     I knew I left it there. And I've hunted and hunted, and I can't find it anywhere. I believe Mildred wore it down town.
