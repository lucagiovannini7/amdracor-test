    PREFACE.
   </head>
   <p>
    The following dramatic bagatelle was written in a few days, and its reception, under every circumstance, far exceeded its merits. I had no idea of printing it, until urged to do so by some friends connected with theatres, who, probably, were desirous of using it without incurring the expense of transcribing from the original manuscript. Writing plays is not my "vocation;" and even if the mania was to seize me, I should have to contend with powerful obstacles, and very stubborn prejudices; to be sure, these, in time, might be removed, but I have no idea of being the first to descend into the arena, and become a gladiator for the American Drama. These prejudices against native productions, however they may be deplored as impugning native genius, are nevertheless very natural. An American audience, I have no doubt, would be highly pleased with an American play, if the performance afforded as much gratification as a good English one; but they pay their money to be pleased, and if we cannot afford pleasure, we have no prescriptive right to ask for approbation. In England, writing of plays is a profession, by which much money is made if the plays succeed; hence a dramatic author goes to work, secundum artem . — He employs all his faculties, exhausts all his resources, devotes his whole time, capacity and ingenuity to the work in hand; the hope of reward stimulates him — the love of fame urges him on — the opposition of rivals animates his exertions and the expectation of applause sweetens his labours — and yet, nine times out of ten, he fails. Mr. Dunlap, of this city, has written volumes of plays, and written well, "excellent well," but he made nothing; nay, he hardly obtained that civic wreath which he fairly earned. Barker, of Philadelphia, whose muse is the most delicate and enticing, has hung up his harp, which, I dare say, is covered with dust and cobwebs; and even Harby, of Charleston, whose talents are of the finest order, and who is a bold yet chaste poet, gained but little profit and applause from his labours. We must not expect, therefore, more encouragement for the American Drama than may be sufficient to urge us on. We will succeed in time, as well as the English, because we have the same language, and equal intellect; but there must be system and discipline in writing plays — a knowledge of stage effect — of sound, cadences, fitness of time and place, interest of plot, spirit of delineation, nature, poetry, and a hundred et ceteras , which are required, to constitute a good dramatic poet, who cannot, in this country, and while occupied in other pursuits, spring up over night like asparagus, or be watered and put in the sun, like a geranium in a flower pot.
   </p>
   <p>
    I wrote this play in order to promote the benefit of a performer who possesses talent, and I have no objections to write another for any deserving object. New plays, in this country, are generally performed, for the first time, as anonymous productions: I did not withhold my name from this, because I knew that my friends would go and see it performed, with the hope of being pleased, and my opponents would go with other motives, so that between the two parties a good house would be the result. This was actually the case, and two performances produced nearly $2,400; I hope this may encourage Americans of more talent to attempt something.
   </p>
   <p>
    National plays should be encouraged. They have done every thing for the British nation, and can do much for us; they keep alive the recollection of important events, by representing them in a manner at once natural and alluring. We have a fine scope, and abundant materials to work with, and a noble country to justify the attempt. The Battle of Chippewa was selected, because it was the most neat and spirited battle fought during the late war, and I wish I was able to do it more justice.

       I am not, my friend; my story is short, and
       you shall hear it. It was my luck, call it bad or
       good, to be born in France, in the town of Castlenaudary,
       where my parents, good honest peasants,
       cultivated a small farm on the borders of the
       canal of Midi. I was useful, though young; we
       were well enough to live, and I received from
       <pb/>
       the parish school a good education, was taught
       to love my country, my parents, and my friends;
       a happy temper, a common advantage in my
       country, made all things easy to me; I never
       looked for to-morrow to bring me more joy than
       I experienced to-day.

       Jen.

      <p>
       Pardon my curiosity, friend Jasper: how
       came you to leave your country, when neither
       want nor misfortune visited your humble dwelling?
      </p>

     <sp who="#jasper">

       Novelty, a desire for change, an ardent
       disposition to visit foreign countries. Passing
       through the streets of Toulouse one bright morning
       in spring, the lively drum and fife broke on
       my ear, as I was counting my gains from a day's
       marketting. A company of soldiers neatly
       dressed, with white cockades, passed me with
       a brisk step; I followed them through instinct —
       the sergeant informed me that they were on their
       way to Bourdeaux, from thence to embark for
       America, to aid the cause of liberty in the new
       world, and were commanded by the Marquis
       de
       la Fayette
       . That name was familiar to me; La
       Fayette was a patriot — I felt like a patriot, and
       joined the ranks immediately.

     <sp who="#jenkins">

     <sp who="#jasper">
      <speaker>
       Jas.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       I did. We had a boisterous passage to
       America, and endured many hardships during
       <pb/>
       the revolution. I was wounded at Yorktown,
       which long disabled me, but what then? I served
       under great men, and for a great cause; I saw
       the independence of the thirteen states acknowledged.
       I was promoted to a sergeancy by the
       great Washington, and I sheathed my sword,
       with the honest pride of knowing, that I had
       aided in establishing a powerful and happy republic.

       You did well, honest Jasper, you did

       your country still free and happy.

     <sp who="#jasper">

      <p>
       I have indeed. When the army was disbanded,
       I travelled on foot to explore the uncultivated
       territory which I had assisted in liberating.
       I purchased a piece of land near the great
       lakes, and with my axe levelled the mighty oaks,
       cleared my meadows, burnt out the wolves and
       bears, and then built that cottage there.

     <sp who="#jenkins">
      <speaker>
       Jen.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       And thus became a settler and my neighbour;
       thanks to the drum and fife and the white
       cockade, that lured you from your home.

       In a short time, Jenkins, every thing
       flourished; my cottage was neat, my cattle thriving,
       still I wanted something — it was a wife. I
       was tired of a solitary life, and married Kate,
       the miller's daughter; you knew her.

     <sp who="#jenkins">

       Jas.
      </speaker>
      <p>
       She was a good wife — ever cheerful and
       industrious, and made me happy: poor Kate! I
       was without children for several years; at length
       my Christine was born, and I have endeavoured,
       in cultivating her mind, and advancing her happiness,
       to console myself for the loss of her
       mother.

       An honest lieutenant of infantry, with a
       gallant spirit and a warm heart. He was wounded
       at Niagara, and one stormy night, he presented
       himself at our cottage door, pale and haggard.
       His arm had been shattered by a ball,
       and he had received a flesh wound from a bayonet:
       we took him in — for an old soldier never
       closes his door on a wounded comrade — Christine
       nursed him, and he soon recovered. But I
       wish they were here — it is growing late: besides,
       this is a busy day, friend Jenkins.

       O she may make a few wry faces, as she
       does when swallowing magnesia, but the dose
       will go down. There is some credit due to a
       wife who improves the intellect of her husband;
       ay, and there is some pride in it also. Girls
       should marry. Matrimony is like an old oak;
       age gives durability to the trunk, skill trims the
       branches, and affection keeps the foliage ever
       green. But come, let us in.

       with so much grace, have swallowed so many
       bitter tinctures with a playful smile, that I
       believe you've been playing the invalid, and

       these scenes, so dear to memory, hospitality,

       Well, that's a very pretty speech, and
       deserves one of my best courtesies. Now suppose
       I should marry you, my "dear Ally Croaker,"
       I shall expect to see myself placed on the
       summit of a baggage-waggon, with soldiers'
       wives and a few dear squalling brats, whose musical
       tones drown e'en the "squeaking of the
       wry-neck'd fife;" and if I should escape from
       the enemy at the close of a battle, I should be
       compelled to be ever ready, and "pack up my
       tatters and follow the drum." — No, no, I can't
       think of it.

       Prithee be serious, dear Christine, your

       you without a sigh? can I depart from that dear
       cottage and rush to battle without having the assurance
       that there is a heart within which beats
       in unison with mine? a heart which can participate
       in my glory, and sympathise in my
       misfortunes?

       No — not so, Lenox; your glory is dear
       to me, your happiness my anxious wish. I have
       seen you bear pain like a soldier, and misfortune
       like a man. I am myself a soldier's daughter,
       and believe me, when I tell you, that under the
       appearance of gaiety, my spirits are deeply depressed
       at your approaching departure. I have
       been taught, by a brave father, to love glory
       when combined with virtue. There is my hand;
       — be constant, and I am ever your friend;
       be true, and you shall find me ever faithful.

       hope for this reward, though it was a daring

       and should we again be triumphant in battle, I
       shall return to claim the reward of constancy — a

       My horse happening to be an old trooper,
       the moment the bugles sounded, and he heard
       the prattle of the small arms, he dashed in
       amongst them, and there was I screaming in a
       most delightful style, which, by some, must have
       been mistaken for a war-whoop, and to mend the
       matter, a very polite and accomplished Indian
       took aim at me with his rifle, and actually shot
       away the plume from my hat, which, I dare say,
       was as valuable a prize to him as I should have
       been.

       cut in before me, and covered my retreat,
       so that in the conclusion of this little affair, I
       gained a feather in my cap, though the enemy
       carried off the plume; and I found myself at last

       Cruel, unkind, false Lenox! are these
       your vows of constancy? are these your protestations
       of love? scarcely are you free from our
       cottage, when your vows and pledges are but
       air. Wretched Christine! what will become of
       you? I have deserted my father's house to avoid
       a hateful match, and seek the protection of the
       man I love; he is false, and I am lost. What's to
       be done? return home a penitent, and meet the
       frowns of my father, and be wedded to the man
       I hate? Never. Seek our Lenox, and upbraid
       him with his falsehood? No, pride and wounded
       honour will not permit me. Let him go — he is
       a wretch who trifles with the affections of a woman.
       I care not what becomes of me, despair is
       all that I have left. Ha! a thought strikes me
       with the lightning's force — the army — I will enlist — this
       disguise is favourable, and in the battle's
       rage, seek that death which quickly awaits

       I can't say, but her father and a whole
       posse comitatus
       , as we justices call 'em, went in
       search of her to the camp, and when I came
       here, I found some of my old comrades who
       fought with me at Queenstown; and so having a
       little money, we went to take a comfortable pitcher
       of whiskey punch together, and so, while over
       our cups, they doubted my valour, and hinted
       that I run away before the battle.

       The enemy then condensed his forces
       and crossed the bridge, and was encountered on
       the plains of Chippewa by Scott, with his brigade,
       when the action became severe and general. No
       ambuscade or masked batteries were held in reserve
       — the enemy was not a moment concealed
       from our view — no tangled thicket or umbrageous
       groves gave effect or facility to our rifles: the
       battle was fought on a plain — where man grap
       pled man, force was opposed to force, skill to
       skill, and eye to eye, in regular, disciplined, and
       admirable order.

       said a hoarse voice which I knew to be
       his. Charge away! said our ardent troops, as
       they advanced with fixed bayonets; the fire became
       dreadful, and our stars and stripes were
       seen waving in the blaze.
       Scott
       rode through
       the lines cheering the men, and gallantly leading
       them on;
       Jessup
       and his third battalion turned

       At length we drove them to their entrenchments,

     <stage>
      — The Camp, as in Act I. Scene III.; the stage is thrown open, drums roll, and the procession enters for the execution of Christine; she is in the centre, between the two detachments; her coat is off, and the stock unloosened from her neck — her step is firm, until she reaches the tent of Lenox, when she clasps her hands and hangs down her head in despair. Procession makes the circuit of the stage with slow steps, and when opposite the tent she kneels; an officer places the bandage over her eyes, and gives a sign to a detachment of four to advance; they step forward, and level their muskets at her; at the moment, Lenox rushes from the tent with the miniature in his hand, and strikes up their guns.

       All things have terminated happily. Our
       arms have been triumphant, and our gallant soldiers
       rewarded with the approbation of their
       country. Love has intwined a wreath for your
       brows, Lenox, and domestic peace and happiness
       await you; and when old age draws on apace,
       may you remember the PLAINS OF CHIPPEWA,
       and feel towards Britain as freemen
       should feel towards all the world: "
       Enemies in
       war — in peace, friends.
