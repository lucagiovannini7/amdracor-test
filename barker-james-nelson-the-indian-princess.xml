    PREFACE.
   </head>
   <p>
    distant hint that the child of my brain deserves a better fate; that it may meet with it I might, however, be indulged in hoping, under the profession that the hope proceeds from considerations distinct from either it or myself. Dramatic genius, with genius of every other kind, is assuredly native of our soil, and there wants but the wholesome and kindly breath of favour to invigorate its delicate frame, and bid it rapidly arise from its cradle to blooming maturity. But alas! poor weak ones! what a climate are ye doomed to draw your first breath in! the teeming press has scarcely ceased groaning at your delivery, ere you are suffocated with the stagnant atmosphere of entire apathy, or swept out of existence by the hurricane of unsparing, indiscriminating censure!
   </p>
   <p>
    Good reader, I begin to suspect that I have held you long enough by the button. Yet, maugre my terror of being tiresome, and in despite of my clear anticipation of the severe puns which will be made in this punning city, on my childish preface, I must push my allusion a little further, to deprecate the wrath of critics, and arouse the sympathies of the ladies. Then, O ye sage censors! ye goody gossips at poetic births! I vehemently importune ye to be convinced, that for my bantling I desire neither rattle nor bells; neither the lullaby of praise, nor the pap of patronage, I may nor the hobby-horse of honour. 'Tis a plain-palated, home-bred, and I may add independent urchin, who laughs at sugar plumbs, and from its little heart disdains gilded gingerbread. If you like it — so; if not — why so; yet, without being mischievous, it would fain be amusing; therefore, if its gambols be pleasant, and your gravities permit, laugh; if not, e'en turn aside your heads, and let the wanton youngling laugh by itself. If it speak like a sensible child, prithee pat its cheek, and say so; but if it be ridiculous when it would be serious, smile, and permit the foolish attempt to pass. But do not, O goody critic, apply the birch, because its unpracticed tongue cannot lisp the language of Shakspeare, nor be very much enraged, if you find it has to creep before it can possibly walk.
   </p>
   <p>
    To your bosoms, ladies, sweet ladies! the little stranger flies with confidence for protection; shield it, I pray you, from the iron rod of rigour, and scold it yourselves, as much as you will, for on your smooth and polished brows it can never read wrinkled cruelty; the mild anger of your eye will not blast it like the fierce scowl of the critic; the chidings of your voice will be soothing music to it, and it will discover the dimple of kindness in your very frowns. Caresses it does not ask; its modesty would shrink from that it thought it deserved not; but of its faults be infantile, its punishment should be gentle, and from you, dear ladies, correction would be as thrillingly sweet as that the little Jean Jacques received from the fair hand of made moiselle Lambereier.

    THE principal materials that from this dramatic trifle are extracted from the General History of Virginia, written by captain Smith, and printed London, folio, 1624; and as close an adherence to historic truth has been preserved as dramatic rules would allow of. The music [Footnote: 1Kb The music is now published and sold by Mr. G. E. Blake, No. 1, South Third-street, Philadelphia. was furnished by Mr. John Bray, of the New Theatre.

       Our hunters are laden with the deer and the soft
       furred beaver. But Miami scorned such prey: I
       watched for the mighty buffaloe and the shaggy
       bear; my club felled them to the ground, and I
       tore their skins from their backs. The fierce carcajou
       had wound himself around the tree, ready to
       <pb n="16"/>
       dart upon the hunter; but the hunter's eyes were
       not closed, and the carcajou quivered on the point
       of my spear. I heard the wolf howl as he looked at
       the moon, and the beams that fell upon his upturned
       face showed my tomahawk the spot it was to enter.
       I marked where the panther had couched, and, before
       he could spring, my arrow went into his heart.

       and whiz came a cloud of arrows about our ears.

       Three tall fellows of ours fell; Cassen, Emery, and

       The battle ceased, for courage left the bosom
       of our warriors; their arrows rested in their
       quivers; their bowstrings no longer sounded; the
       tired chieftains leaned on their war-clubs, and gazed
       at the terrible stranger, whom they dared not approach.
       Give an ear to me, king: 'twas then I
       held out the hand of peace to him, and he became
       my brother; he forgot his arms, for he trusted to
       his brother; he was discoursing wonders to his
       friend, when our chiefs rushed upon him, and
       bore him away. But oh! my father, he must not
       die; for he is not a war captive; I promised that
       the chain of friendship should be bright between us.

       Marry, girl, thus it was: when we had given
       the enemies of our ally, Powhatan, defeature,
       and sent the rough Miami in chains to Werocomoco,
       our captain dispatches his lieutenant, Rolfe, to
       supply his place, here, in the town; and leading us
       to the water's edge, and leaping into the pinnace,
       away went we on a voyage of discovery. Some
       thousand miles we sailed, and many strange nations
       discovered; and for our exploits, if posterity reward
       us not, there is no faith in history.
