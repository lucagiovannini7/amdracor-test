    PREFACE.
   </head>
   <p>
    More than nine years ago the Author made choice of the death of Major André as the subject of a Tragedy, and part of what is now offered to the public was written at that time. Many circumstances discouraged him from finishing his Play, and among them must be reckoned a prevailing opinion that recent events are unfit subjects for tragedy. These discouragements have at length all given way to his desire of bringing a story on the Stage so eminently fitted, in his opinion, to excite interest in the breasts of an American audience.
   </p>
   <p>
    In exhibiting a stage representation of a real transaction, the particulars of which are fresh in the minds of many of the audience, an author has this peculiar difficulty to struggle with, that those who know the events expect to see them all recorded; and any deviation from what they remember to be fact, appears to them as a fault in the poet; they are disappointed, their expectations are not fulfilled, and the writer is more or less condemned, not considering the difference between the poet and the historian, or not knowing that what is intended to be exhibited is a free poetical picture, not an exact historical portrait.
   </p>
   <p>
    Still further difficulties has the Tragedy of André to surmount, difficulties independent of its own demerits, in its way to public favor. The subject necessarily involves political questions; but the Author presumes that he owes no apology to any one for having shewn himself an American. The friends of Major André (and it appears that all who knew him were his friends) will look with a jealous eye on the Poem, whose principal incident is the sad catastrophe which his misconduct, in submitting to be an instrument in a transaction of treachery and deceit, justly brought upon him: but these friends have no cause of offence; the Author has adorned the poetical character of André with every virtue; he has made him his Hero; to do which, he was under the necessity of making him condemn his own conduct, in the one dreadfully unfortunate action of his life. To shew the effects which Major André's excellent qualities had upon the minds of men, the Author has drawn a generous and amiable youth, so blinded by his love for the accomplished Briton, as to consider his country, and the great commander of her armies, as in the commission of such horrid injustice, that he, in the anguish of his soul, disclaims the service. In this it appears, since the first representation, that the Author has gone near to offend the veterans of the American army who were present on the first night, and who not knowing the sequel of the action, felt much disposed to condemn him: but surely they must remember the diversity of opinion which agitated the minds of men at that time, on the question of the propriety of putting André to death; and when they add the circumstances of André's having saved the life of this youth, and gained his ardent friendship, th³y will be inclined to mingle with their disapprobation, a sentiment of pity, and excuse, perhaps commend, the Poet, who has represented the action without sanctioning it by his approbation.
   </p>
   <p>
    As a sequel to the affair of the cockade, the Author has added the following lines, which the reader is requested to insert, page 55, between the 5th and 15th lines, instead of the lines he will find there, which were printed before the piece was represented. —
   </p>
   <head>
    Bland.
   </head>
   <p rend="l">
    Noble M'Donald, truth and honor's champion!
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Yet think not strange that my intemperance wrong'd thee:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Good as thou art! for, would'st thou, can'st thou, think it?
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    My tongue, unbridled, hath the same offence,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    With action violent, and boisterous tone;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Hurl'd on that glorious man, whose pious labours
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Shield from every ill his grateful country!
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    That man, whom friends to adoration love,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And enemies revere. — Yes, M'Donald,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Even in the presence of the first of men
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Did I abjure the service of my country,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And rest my helmet of that glorious badge
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Which graces even the brow of Washington.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    How shall I see him more! —
   </p>
   <head>
    M'Donald.
   </head>
   <p rend="l">
    Alive himself to every generous impulse,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    He hath excus'd the impetuous warmth of youth,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    In expectation that thy fiery soul,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Chasten'd by time and reason, will receive
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    The stamp indelible of godlike virtue.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    To me, in trust, he gave this badge disclaim'd,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    With power, when thou should'st see thy wrongful error,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    From him, to reinstate it in thy helm,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And thee in his high favour. (Gives the cockade.)
   </p>
   <head>
    Bland (Takes the cockade and replaces
                            it.)
   </head>
   <p rend="l">
    Shall I speak my thoughts of thee and him?
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    No: — let my actions henceforth shew what thou
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And he have made me. Ne'er shall my helmet
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Lack again its proudest, noblest ornament,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Until my country knows the rest of peace,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Or Bland the peace of death!
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Exit.
   </p>
   <p>
    This alteration, as well as the whole performance, on the second night, met the warm approbation of the audience.
   </p>
   <p>
    To the performers the Author takes this opportunity of returning his thanks for their exertions in his behalf; perfectly convinced, that on this, as on former occasions, the members of the Old American Company have anxiously striven to oblige him.
   </p>
   <p>
    If this Play is successful, it will be a proof that recent events may be so managed in tragedy as to command popular attention; if it is unsuccessful, the question must remain undetermined until some more powerful writer shall again make the experiment. The Poem is now submitted to the ordeal of closet examination, with the Author's respectful assurance to every reader, that as it is not his interest, so it has not been his intention to offend any; but, on the contrary, to impress, through the medium of a pleasing stage exhibition, the sublime lessons of Truth and Justice upon the minds of his countrymen.

    PROLOGUE.  Spoken by Mr. Martin.
   </head>
   <p rend="l">
    A Native Bard, a native scene displays,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And claims your candour for his daring lays:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Daring, so soon, in mimic scenes to shew,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    What each remembers as a real woe.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who has forgot when gallant Andre died?
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    A name by Fate to Sorrow's self allied.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who has forgot, when o'er the untimely bier,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Contending armies paus'd, to drop a tear.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Our Poet builds upon a fact to-night;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Yet claims, in building, every Poet's right:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    To choose, embellish, lop, or add, or blend,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Fiction with truth, as best may suit his end;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Which, he avows, is pleasure to impart,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And move the passions but to mend the heart.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    O, may no party-spirit blast his views,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Or turn to ill the meanings of the Muse:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    She sings of wrongs long past, Men as they were,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    To instruct, without reproach, the Men that are;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Then judge the Story by the genius shown,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And praise, or damn it, for its worth alone.

    AUTHENTIC DOCUMENTS  RELATIVE TO  MAJOR ANDRE.
Presuming that the readers of the foregoing Drama would be gratified by
                            an account of the Hero, divested of all ornament, and separated from
                            poetic fiction, I have collected every thing relative to him which has
                            been made public, and shall state it in the fullest and most simple
                            manner, according to the natural order of time.
LETTERS
Addressed to Miss Seward by Major Andre , when he was a youth of eighteen.

Clapton, October 3, 1769.

From their agreeable excursion to Shrewsbury my friends are by this time returned to their
                            beloved Lichfield. Once again have they beheld those
                            fortunate spires, the constant witnesses of all their pains and
                            pleasures. I can well conceive the emotions of joy which their first
                            appearance, from the neighbouring hills, excites after absence; — they
                            seem to welcome you home, and invite you to reiterate those hours of
                            happiness, of which they are a species of monument. I shall have an
                            eternal love and reverence for them. Never shall I forget the joy that
                            danced in Honora's eyes, when she first shewed them
                            to me from the Needwood Forest, on our return with you from Buxton to
                            Lichfield. I remember she called them the Ladies of the
                                Valley — their lightness and elegance deserve the title. Oh!
                            how I lov'd them from that instant! My enthusiasm concerning them is
                            carried farther even than your's and Honora's , for
                            every object that has a pyramidal form, recalls them to my recollection,
                                 with a sensation, that brings the tear of pleasure into
                            my eyes.
How happy must you have been at Shrewsbury! only that you tell me, alas!
                            that dear Honora was not so well as you wished during
                            your stay there. — I always hope the best. My impatient spirit rejects
                            every obtruding idea, which I have not fortitude to support — — Doctor
                            Darwin's skill, and your tender care, will remove that sad pain in her
                            side, which makes writing troublesome and injurious to her; which robs
                            her poor Cher Jean
                            [Footnote: 1Kb
                            A name of kindness, by which Mr. André was often
                                called by his mother and sisters, and generally adopted by the
                                persons mentioned in these letters. of those precious pages,
                            with which he flatters himself, she would otherwise have indulged
                            him.
So, your happiness at Shrewsbury scorn'd to be indebted to public
                            amusements — five virgins — united in the soft bonds of friendship! — —
                            How I should have lik'd to have made the sixth! — — But you surprize me
                            by such an absolute exclusion of the Beaux — I certainly thought that
                            when five wise virgins were watching at midnight, it must have been in
                            expectation of the bridegroom's coming. We are at this instant five
                            virgins, writing round the same table — my three sisters, Mr. Ewer, and
                            myself. I beg no reflections injurious to the honor of poor Cher Jean. My mother is gone to pay a visit, and has
                            left us in possession of the old coach; but as for nags, we can boast of
                            only two long-tails, and my sisters say they are sorry cattle, being no
                            other than my friend Ewer and myself, who, to say truth, have enormous
                            pig-tails.
My dear Boiffier is come to town; he has brought a little of the soldier
                            with him; but he is the same honest, warm, intelligent friend I always
                            found him. He sacrifices the town diversions, since I will not partake
                            of them.
We are jealous of your correspondents, who are so numerous — yet, write
                            to the Andrés often, my dear Julia , for who are they
                            that will value your letters quite as much as we value them? — The leaft
                            scrap of a letter will be received  with the greatest joy —
                            write, therefore, though it were only to give us the comfort of having a
                            piece of paper which has recently passed through your hands — Honora will put in a little postscript, were it only
                            to tell me that she is my very sincere friend , who
                            will neither give me love nor comfort — Very short, indeed, Honora , was thy last postscript! — But I am too
                            presumptuous; I will not scratch out, but I un say —
                            from the little there was I received more joy than I deserve. This Cher Jean is an impertinent fellow, but he will grow
                            discreet in time — you must consider him as a poor novice of eighteen , who, for all the sins he may commit, is
                            sufficiently punished in the single evil of being 120 miles from
                            Lichfield.
My mother and sisters will go to Putney in a few days, to stay some time
                            — We none of us like Clapton — I need not care, for I am all day long in
                            town; but it is avoiding Scylla to fall into Charybdis. You paint to me
                            the pleasant vale of Stow in the richest autumnal colouring In return I
                            must tell you, that my zephyrs are wafted through cracks in the
                            wainscot; for murmuring streams I have dirty kennels; for bleating
                            flocks, grunting pigs; and squalling cats for birds that incessantly
                            warble — I have said something of this sort in my letter to Miss
                            Spearman, and am twing'd with the idea of these epistles being
                            confronted, and that I shall recall to your memory the fat knight's love
                            letters to Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page.

Julia , perhaps thou fanciest I am merry — Alas! But I
                            do not with to make you as doleful as myself; and besides, when I would
                            express the tender feelings of my soul, I have no language which does
                            them any justice; if I had, I should regret that you could not have it
                            fresher, and that whatever one communicates by letter must go such a
                            roundabout way, before it reaches one's correspondent; from the writer's
                            heart through his head, arm, hand, pen, ink, paper, over many a weary
                            hill and dale, to the eye, head, and heart of the reader. I have often
                            regretted our not possessing a sort of faculty which should enable our
                            sensations, remarks, &amp;.mp;c. to arise from their source in a sort of
                            exhalation, and  fall upon our paper in words and phrases
                            properly adapted to express them, without passing through an imagination
                            whose operations so often fail to second those of the heart. Then what a
                            metamorphose should we see in people's stile! How eloquent those who are
                            truly attached! How stupid they who falsely profess affection! Perhaps
                            the former had never been able to express half their regard; while the
                            latter, by their flowers of rhetoric, had made us believe a thousand
                            times more than they ever felt; but this is whimsical moralizing.
My sisters' Penserosos were dispersed on their arrival in town, by the
                            joy of seeing Louisa and their dear little brother Billy again, our kind
                            and excellent uncle Giradot, and uncle Lewis André. I was glad to see
                            them; but they complained, not without reason, of the gloom upon my
                            countenance: Billy wept for joy that we were returned, while poor Cher Jean was ready to weep for sorrow. Louisa is
                            grown still handsomer since we left her. Our sisters, Mary and Anne,
                            knowing your partiality to beauty, are afraid that when they shall
                            introduce her to you, she will put their noses out of joint. Billy is
                            not old enough for me to be afraid of in the rival way, else I should
                            keep him aloof, for his heart is formed of those affectionate materials,
                            so dear to the ingenuous taste of Julia and her Honora.

I sympathize in your resentment against the Canonical Dons, who stumpify
                            the heads of those good green people, [Footnote:
                                    1Kb
                            The trees in the Cathedral walk in
                                Lichfield. beneath whose friendly shade so many of your
                            happiest hours have glided away; but they defy them; let them stumpify
                            as much as they please; time will repair the mischief; their verdant
                            arms will again extend, and invite you to their shelter.
The evenings grow very long; I hope your conversation round the fire will
                            sometimes fall on the Andrés; it will be a great comfort that they are
                            remembered. We chink our glasses to your healths at every meal; here's
                            to our Lichfieldian friends, says Nanny; — Oh — ho, says Mary; with  all my soul, says I; alons, cries my mother; and the
                            draught seems nectar. The libation made us begin our uncloying theme,
                            and so beguile the gloomy evening.
Mr. and Mrs. Seward will accept my most affectionate respects — My male
                            friend at Lichfield will join in your conversation on the Andrés. Among
                            the numerous good qualities he is possessed of, he certainly has
                            gratitude, and then he cannot forget those who so sincerely love and
                            esteem him; I, in particular, shall always recall with pleasure the
                            happy hours I have passed in his company; my friendship for him, and for
                            your family, has diffused itself, like the precious ointment from
                            Aaron's beard, on every thing which surrounds you; therefore I beg you
                            would give my amities to the whole town. Persuade Honora to forgive the length and ardour of the inclosed, and
                            believe me truly,
Your affectionate and faithful friend,
J. ANDRE.
LETTER II.

London, October 19, 1769.

From the midst of books, papers, bills, and other
                            implements of gain, let me lift up my drowsy head a while, to converse
                            with dear Julia. And first, as I know she has a
                            servent wish to see me a quill-driver, I must tell her, that I begin, as
                            most people are wont to do, to look upon my future profession with great
                            partiality. I no longer see it in so disadvantageous a light. Instead of
                            figuring a merchant as a middle aged man, with a bob wig, a rough beard,
                            in snuff coloured clothes, grasping a guinea in his red hand; I conceive
                            a comely young man, with a tolerable pig-tail, wielding a pen with all
                            the noble fierceness of the Duke of Marlborough brandishing a truncheon
                            upon a sign post, surrounded with types and emblems, and canopied with
                            cornucopies that disembogue their stores upon his head; Mercuries  reclin'd upon bales of goods; Genii playing with pens, ink
                            and paper; while, in perspective, his gorgeous vessels "launch'd on the
                            bosom of the silver Thames," are wafting to distant lands the produce of
                            this commercial nation. Thus all the mercantile glories crowd on my
                            fancy, emblazoned in the most refulgent colouring of an ardent
                            imagination — Borne on her soaring pinions, I wing my flight to the time
                            when Heaven shall have crowned my labours with success and opulence. I
                            see sumptuous palaces rising to receive me. I see orphans and widows,
                            and painters, fidlers, and poets, and builders, protected and
                            encouraged; and when the fabrick is pretty near finished by my shattered
                            pericranium, I cast my eyes around, and find John André, by a small coal
                            fire, in a gloomy compting-house in Warnford court, nothing so little as
                            what he has been making himself, and in all probability never to be much
                            more than he is at present. But oh! my dear Honora !
                            it is for thy sake only I wish for wealth. You say she was somewhat
                            better at the time you wrote last. I must flatter myself that she will
                            soon be without any remains of this threatening disease.
It is seven o'clock; you and Honora , with two or
                            three more select friends, are now probably encircling your
                            dressing-room fire-place. What would I not give to enlarge that circle!
                            The idea of a clean hearth, and a snug circle round it, formed by a few
                            sincere friends, transports me. You seem combined together against the
                            inclemency of the weather, the hurry, bustle, ceremony, censoriousness,
                            and envy of the world. The purity, the warmth, the kindling influence of
                            fire, to all for whom it is kindled, is a good emblem of the friendship
                            of such amiable minds as Julia's and her Honora's. Since I cannot be there in reality, pray
                            imagine me with you; admit me to your conversations; think how I wish
                            for the blessing of joining them! and be persuaded that I take part in
                            all your pleasures, in the dear hope, that e'er it be very long, your
                            blazing hearth will burn again for me. Pray keep me a place; let the
                            poker, tongs, or shovel represent me; but you  have Dutch
                            tiles, which are infinitely better; so let Moses, or Aaron, or Balaam's
                            ass, be my representative.
But time calls me to Clapton. I quit you abruptly till to-morrow: when,
                            if I do not tear the nonsense I have been writing, I may perhaps
                            increase its quantity. Signora Cynthia is in clouded majesty. Silvered
                            with her beams I am about to jog to Clapton upon my own stumps; musing
                            as I homeward plod my way. Ah! need I name the subject of my
                            contemplation!
Thursday.
I had a sweet walk home last night, and found the Claptonians, with their
                            fair guest, a Miss Mourgue, very well. My sisters send their amities,
                            and will write in a few days.
This morning I returned to town. It has been the finest day imaginable. A
                            solemn mildness was diffused throughout the blue horizon; its light was
                            clear and distinct, rather than dazzling; the serene beams of the
                            autumnal sun, gilded hills, variegated woods, glittering spires,
                            ruminating herds, bounding flocks, all combined to enchant the eyes,
                            expand the heart, and "chace all sorrow but despair." In the midst of
                            such a scene, no lesser grief can prevent our sympathy with nature — — A
                            calmness, a benevolent disposition seizes us with sweet insinuating
                            power. The very brute creation seem sensible of these beauties; there is
                            a species of mild cheerfulness in the face of a lamb, which I have but
                            indifferently expressed in a corner of my paper; and a demure contented
                            look in an ox, which, in the fear of expressing still worse, I leave
                            unattempted.
Business calls me away. I must dispatch my letter. Yet, what does it
                            contain? No matter, you like any thing better than news. Indeed, you
                            never told me so, but I have an intuitive knowledge upon the subject,
                            from the sympathy which I have constantly perceived in the taste of Julia and Cher Jean. What is it
                            to you or me,
If here in the city we have nothing but riot,
If the Spitalfield weavers can't be kept quiet.
If the weather is fine, or the streets should be dirty
Or if Mr. Dick Wilson died aged of thirty?
But, if I was to hearken to the versifying grumbling I feel within me, I
                            should fill my paper, and not have room left to intreat that you would
                            plead my cause to Honora more eloquently than the
                            inclosed letter has the power of doing. Apropos of verses, you desire me
                            to recollect my random description of the engaging appearance of the
                            charming Mrs. — — . Here it is at your service — — 
Then rustling and bustling the lady comes down,
With a flaming red face, and a broad yellow gown,
And a hobbling out-of-breath gait, and a srown.
This little French cousin of ours, Delariseé, was my sister Mary's
                            play-fellow at Paris. His sprightliness engages my sisters extremely.
                            Doubtles they talk much of him to you in their letters.
How sorry I am to bid you adieu! Oh let me not be forgot by the friends
                            most dear to you at Lichfield! Lichfield ! Ah! of
                            what magic letters it that little word composed! How graceful it looks
                            when it is written! Let nobody talk to me of its original meaning. "The
                            field of blood!" Oh! no such thing! It is the field of joy! "The
                            beautiful city, that lifts up her fair head in the valley, and says, I
                            am, and there is none beside me!" Who says she is vain? Julia will not say so — — nor yet Honora ;
                            and least of all their devoted
JOHN ANDRE.
LETTER III.

Clapton, November 1, 1769.

My ears still ring with the sounds of oh Jack! oh
                            Jack! How do the dear Lichfieldians? — What do they say? — What are they
                            about? — What did you do while you were with them? — Have patience, said
                            I, good people; and began  my story, which they devoured
                            with as much joyful avidity as Adam did Gabriel's tidings of heaven. —
                            My mother and sisters are all very well, and delighted with their little
                            Frenchman, who is a very agreeable lad.
Surely you applaud the fortitude with which I left you! Did I not come
                            off with flying colours? — It was a great effort; for, alas! this
                            recreant heart did not second the smiling courage of the countenance;
                            nor is it yet as it ought to be, from the hopes it may reasonably
                            entertain of seeing you all again e'er the winter's dreary hours are
                            past. — Julia , my dear Julia ,
                            gild them with tidings of our beloved Honora ! — Oh
                            that you may be enabled to tell me that she regains her health, and her
                            charming vivacity! Your sympathizing heart partakes all the joys and
                            pains of your friends. — Never can I forget its kind offices, which were
                            of such moment to my peace! — Mine is formed for friendship; and I am
                            blest in being able to place so well the purest passion of an ingenuous
                            mind! — How am I honored in Mr. and Mrs. Seward's attachment to me! —
                            Charming were the anticipations which beguiled the long tracts of hill,
                            and dale, and plain, that divide London from Lichfield! — With what
                            delight my eager eyes drank their first view of the dear spires! — What
                            rapture did I not feel on entering your gates! in flying up the hall
                            steps! in rushing into the dining-room! in meeting the gladdened eyes of
                            dear Julia and her enchanting friend! — That instant
                            convinced me of the truth of Rousseau's observation, "That there are
                            moments worth ages." Shall not those moments return? Ah Julia ! the cold hand of absence is heavy upon the heart of
                            your poor Cher Jean — he is forced to hammer into it
                            perpetually every consoling argument that the magic wand of hope can
                            conjure up, viz. that every moment of industrious absence advance his
                            journey, you know whither. — I may sometimes make excursions to
                            Lichfield, and bask in the light of my Honora's eyes!
                            — Sustain me hope! nothing or my part shall be wanting which may induce
                            thee to fulfil thy blossoming promises.
The happy, social circle, Julia, Honora , Miss S---n,
                                 Miss B---n, her brother, Mr. S---e, Mr. R---n, &amp;.mp;c. &amp;.mp;c.
                            are now, perhaps, enlivening your dressing-room, the dear blue region,
                            as Honora calls it, with the sensible observation,
                            the tasteful criticism, or the elegant song; dreading the iron tongue of
                            the nine o'clock bell, which disperses the being whom friendship and
                            kindred virtues had drawn together. — My imagination attaches itself to
                            all, even the inanimate objects which surround Honora
                            and her Julia ; that have beheld their graces and
                            virtues expand and ripen; my dear Honora's , from
                            their infant bud.
The sleepy Claptonian train are gone to bed, somewhat wearied with their
                            excursion to Enfield, whither they have this day carried their little
                            Frenchman; so great a favorite, the parting was quite tragical. I walked
                            hither from town, as usual, to-night — no hour of the twenty-four is so
                            precious to me as that devoted to this solitary walk. — Oh, my friend! I
                            am far from possessing the patient frame of mind which I so continually
                            invoke! — Why is Lichfield an hundred and twenty miles from me? — There
                            is no moderation in the distance! Fifty or sixty miles had been a great
                            deal too much; but then there would have been less opposition from
                            authority to my frequent visits. — I conjure you supply the want of
                            these blessings by frequent letters. I must not, will not ask them of
                                Honora , since the use of the pen is forbid to
                            her declining health. I will content myself, as usual, with a postscript
                            from her in your epistles. — My sisters are charmed with the packet
                            which arrived yesterday, and which they will answer soon.
As yet I have said nothing of our journey. We met an entertaining Irish
                            gentleman at Dunchurch, and being fellow sufferers in cold and hunger,
                            joined interests, ordered four horses, and stuffed three in a chaise. —
                            It is not to you I need apologize for talking in raptures of an higher,
                            whom we met on our road. His cart had passed us, and was at a
                            considerable distance, when looking back, he perceived that our chaise
                            had stopped, and that the driver seemed mending something. He ran up to
                            him, and with a face full of honest anxiety, pity, good nature, and
                            every sweet  affection under heaven, asked him if he wanted
                            any thing; that he had plenty of nails, ropes, &amp;.mp;c. in his cart — — That
                            wretch of postilion made no other reply than, "We want nothing, master."
                            From the same impulse, the good Irishman, Mr. Till, and myself, thrust
                            our heads instantly out of the chaise, and tried to recompence to the
                            honest creature the surly reply, by every kind and grateful
                            acknowledgment, and by forcing upon him a little pecuniary tribute. My
                            benevolence will be the warmer, while I live, for the treasured
                            remembrance of this highler's countenance.
I know you interest yourself in my destiny — — I have now compietely
                            subdued my aversion to the profession of a merchant, and hope in time to
                            acquire an inclination for it. — — Yet, God forbid I should ever love
                            what I am to make the object of my attention! — that vile trash, which I
                            care not for, but only as it may be the future means of procuring the
                            blessing of my soul — — Thus all my mercantile calculations go to the
                            tune of dear Honora : — — When an impertinent
                            consciousness whispers in my ear, that I am not of the right stuff for a
                            merchant, I draw my Honora's picture from my bosom,
                            and the sight of that dear talisman so inspires my industry, that no
                            toil appears oppressive.
The poetic task you set me is in a sad method — My head and heart are too
                            full of other matters to be engrossed by a draggle-tailed wench of the
                            Henconian puddle.
I am going to try my interest in Parliament — How you stare! — It is to
                            procure a frank. — Be so good to give the enclosed to Honora — it will speak to her — and do you say every thing
                            that is kind of me to every other distinguished friend of the
                            dressing-room circle — encourage them in their obliging desire of
                            scribbling in your letters; but do not let them take Honora's corner of the sheet.
Adieu! — May you all possess that cheerfulness denied to your Cher Jean. I fear it hurts my mother to see my
                            musing moods; but I can neither help nor overcome them. The near hopes
                            of another excursion to Lichfield could alone disperse every gloomy
                            vapour of my imagination.
Again, and yet again, adieu!
J. ANDRE.
WE find annexed to Miss Seward's Monody on Major André
                            this note: — 
"Miss Honora S---, to whom Mr. André's attachment was
                            of such singular constancy, died, in a consumption, a few months before
                            he suffered death at Tappan. She had married another gentleman four
                            years after her engagement with Mr. André had been dissolved by parental
                            authority."
By another note we are informed, that, on receiving the tidings of Honora's marriage, Mr. André quitted his profession
                            as a merchant, and joined the British army in America.
Another note has these words: — 
"A letter from Major André to one of his friends, written a few years
                            ago, contained the following sentence: — 'I have been taken prisoner by
                            the Americans, and stript of every thing except the picture of Honora , which I concealed in my mouth. Preserving
                            that, I yet think myself fortunate.'"
In the year 1780 Major André amused himself and his friends by writing
                            the following little Poem, called the Cow Chace ;
                            and Mr. James Rivington, at that time printer to his Britannic Majesty
                            in New-York, says, that the poet gave him the last Canto the day before
                            he left town on the fatal expedition, and that it appeared in the Royal
                            Gazette the morning of the day André was taken. The last stanza has been
                            called prophetic; and the perile idea has been entertained by many, and
                            even adopted by Miss Seward, that this triffling performance influenced
                            the Court-martial in their decision on the trial of its author!
THE  COW CHACE.
CANTO I.

To drive the kine one summer's morn,
 The tanner took his way;
The calf shall rue that is unborn
 The jumbling of that day.
And Wayne descending steers shall know,
 And tauntingly deride,
And call to mind in every low
 The tanning of his hide.
Yet Bergen cows still ruminate
 Unconscious in the stall,
What mighty means were used to get
 And loose them after all.
For many heroes bold and brave
 From New-Bridge and Tapaan,
And those that drink Passaick's wave,
 And those that eat soupaan;
And sons of distant Delaware,
 And still remoter Shannon,
And Major Lee, with horses rare,
 And Proctor with his cannon:
All wound'rous proud in arms they came;
 What hero could refuse,
To tread the rugged path to fame,
 Who had a pair of shoes?
At six the host with sweating buff,
 Arrived at freedom's pole;
When Wayne, who thought he'd time enough,
 Thus speechified the whole:
"O ye whom glory doth unite,
 Who freedom's cause espouse,
Whether the wing that's doom'd to fight,
 Or that to drive the cows!
Ere yet you tempt your further way,
 Or into action come,
Hear, soldiers, what I have to say,
 And take a pint of rum.
Intemp'rate valour then will string
 Each nervous arm the better;
So all the land shall IO sing,
 And read the Gen'ral's letter.
Know that some paltry refugees
 Whom I've a mind to fight,
Are playing h---l amongst the trees,
 That grow on younder height.
Their fort and block-houses we'll level,
 And deal a horrid slaughter;
We'll drive the scondrels to the devil,
  
I, under cover of th' attack,
 Whilst you are all at blows,
From English Neighb'rood and Tinack
 Will drive away the cows.
For well you know the latter is
 The serious operation;
And fighting with the refugees
 Is only demonstration."
His daring words from all the crowd
 Such great applause did gain,
That every man declar'd aloud
 For serious work with Wayne.
Then from the cask of rum once more
 They took a heady jill,
When one and all they loudly swore
 They'd fight upon the hill.
But here — — the Muse has not a strain
 Befitting such great deeds;
Huzza, they cried, huzza for Wayne
  
CANTO II.
NEAR his meridian pomp the sun
 Had journey's from th' horizon,
When fierce the dusky tribe mov'd on,
 Of heroes drunk as poison.
The sounds confused of boasting oaths,
 Re-echoed thro' the wood;
Some vow'd to sleep in dead men's clothes
 And some to swim in blood.
At Irvine's nod 'twas fine to see
 The left prepare to fight,
The while the drovers, Wayne and Lee,
 Drew off upon the right.
Which Irvine 'twas, Fame don't relate,
 Nor can the Muse assist her,
Whether 'twas he that cocks a hat,
 Or he that 
For greatly one was signalized,
 That fought at Chesnut-Hill;
And Canda immortalized
 The vender of the pill.
Yet the attendance upon Proctor,
 They both might have to boast of;
For there was business for the doctor,
 And hats to be disposed of.
Let none uncandidly infer,
 That Stirling wanted spunk;
The self-made peer had sure been there,
 But that the peer was drunk.
But turn we to the Hudson's banks,
 Where stood the modest train,
With purpose firm, tho' slender ranks,
 Nor car'd a pin for Wayne.
For them the unrelenting hand
 Of rebel fury drove,
And tore from ev'ry genial band,
 Of friendship and of love.
And some within a dungeon's gloom,
 By mock tribunals laid;
Had waited long a cruel doom,
 Impending o'er their heads.
Here one bewails a brother's fate,
 There one a sire demands,
Cut off, alas! before their date,
 By ignominious hands.
And silver'd grandsires here appear'd,
 In deep distress serene,
Of reverend manners, that declared
 The better days they'd seen.
Oh curs'd rebellion! these are thine,
 Thine are these tales of woe;
Shall at thy dire insatiate shrine
 Blood never cease to flow?
And now the foe began to lead
 His forces to the attack;
Balls whistling unto balls succeed,
 And make the block-house crack.
No shot could pass if you will take
 The Gen'ral's word for true;
But 'tis a d---ble mistake,
 For ev'ry shot went thro'.
The firmer as the rebels press'd,
 The loyal heroes stand;
Virtue had nerv'd each honest breast,
 And industry each hand.
"In [Footnote: 1Kb
                            Vide Lee's trial. valour's phrenzy,
                            Hamilton
 Rode like a soldier big,
And secretary Harrison,
 With pen stuck in his wig."
"But least their chieftain Washington,
 Should mourn them in the mumps,
The fate of Withrington to shun,
 They fought behind the stumps."
But ah, Thadæus Posset, why
 Should thy poor soul elope?
And why should Titus Hooper die,
 Ah die — without a rope?
Apostate Murphy, thou to whom
 Fair Shela ne'er was cruel,

In death shalt hear her mourn thy doom,
 Auch wou'd you die my jewel?
Thee Nathan Pumpkin I lament,
 Of melancholy fate,
The grey goose stolen as he went,
 In his heart's blood was wet.
Now as the fight was further fought,
 And balls began to thicken,
The fray assum'd, the Gen'rals thought,
 The colour of a licking.
Yet undismay'd the chiefs command,
 And, to redeem the day,
Cry, SOLDIERS CHARGE! they hear, they stand,
 They turn, and run away.
CANTO III.
NOT all delights the bloody spear,
 Or horrid din of battle,
There are, I'm sure, who'd like to hear,
 A word about the cattle.
The chief whom we beheld of late,
 Near Schralenberg haranguing,
At Yan Van Poop's, unconscious sat,
 Of Irvine's hearty banging.
Whilst valiant Lee, with courage wild,
 Most bravely did oppose
The tears of woman and of child,
 Who begg'd he'd leave the cows.
But Wayne, of sympathising heart,
 Required a relief,
Not all the blessings could impart
 Of battle or of beef;
For now a prey to female charms,
 His soul took more delight in
A lovely [Footnote: 1Kb
                            A deity of the woods. Hamadryad's
                            arms,
 Than cow driving or fighting:
A nympth, the refugees had drove,
 Far from her native tree,
Just happen'd to be on the move,
 When up came Wayne and Lee.
She in mad Anthony's fierce eye,
 The hero saw poutray'd;
And all in tears she took him by
  — — The bridle of his jade.
Hear, said the nymph, O great commander!
 No human lamentations;
The trees you see them cutting younder,
 Are all my near relations.
And I, forlorn! implore thine aid,
 To free the sacred grove;
So shall thy prowess be repaid
 With an Immortal's love.
Now some, to prove she was a Goddess,
 Said this enchanting fair
Had late retired fore the bodies , [Footnote:
                                    1Kb
                            A cant appellation given amongst the soldiery to
                                the corps that has the honor to guard his Majesty's
                            person.
 In all the pomp of war.
That drums and merry fifes had play'd
 To honor her retreat,
And Cunningham himself convey'd
 The lady thro' the street.
Great Wayne, by soft compassion sway'd,
 To no inquiry stoops,
But takes the fair afflicted maid
  Right into Yan Van Poop's.
So Roman Anthony, they say,
 Disgraced the imperial banner,
And for a gypsy lost the day,
 Like Anthony the tanner.




When drums and colours, cow and calf,
 Came down the read amain:
All in a cloud of dust were seen
 The sheep, the horse, the goat,
The gentle heifer, ass obscene,
 The yearling and the shoat.
And pack-horses with fowls came by,
 Befeather'd on each side,
Like Pegasus, the horse that I
 And other poets ride.
Sublime upon his stirrups rose
 The mighty Lee behind,
And drove the terror-smitten cows
 Like chaff before the wind.
But sudden see the woods above
 Pour down another corps;
All helter skelter in a drove,
 Like that I sung before.
Irvine and terror in the van
 Came flying all abroad;
And cannon, colours, horse and man,
 Ran tumbling to the road.
Still as he fled, 'twas Irvine's cry,
 And his example too,
"Run on, my merry men all — For why?
 The shot will not go thro'."
Five refugees ('tis true) were found
 Stiff on the block-house floor,
But then 'tis thought the shot went round,
 And in at the back door.
As when too kennels in the street,
 Swell'd with a recent rain,
In gushing streams together meet,
 And seek the neighbouring drain:
So met these dung-born tribes in one,
 As swift in their career;
And so to New-Bridge they ran on, — 
 But all the cows got clear.
Poor parson — — , all in wonder,
 Saw the returning train,
And mourn'd to Wayne the lack of plunder
 For them to steal again.
For 'twas his right to seize the spoil, and
 To share with each commander,
As he had done at Staten-Island,
 With frost-bit Alexander.
                        [Footnote: 1Kb
                        Lord Stirling before mentioned.
                        
                        In his dismay the frantic priest
 Began to grow prophetic,
You'd swore, to see his lab'ring breast,
 He'd taken an emetic.
I view a future day, said he,
 Brighter than this day dark is,
And you shall see what you shall see,
 Ha! ha! one pretty Marquis;
And he shall come to Paul's-book,
 And great achievements think on;
And make a bow, and take a look,
 Like mean over Lincoln.
And all the land around shall glory
 To see the Frenchmen caper,
And pretty Susan tell the story
 In the next Chatham paper.
This solemn prophecy, of course,
 Gave all much consolation,
Except to Wayne, who lost his horse
 Upon the great occasion.
His horse that carried all his prog,
 His military speeches,
His corn-stalk whisky for his grog,
 Blue stockings, and brown breeches.
And now I've clos'd my epic strain,
 I tremble as I shew it,
Lest this same warrior-drover, Wayne,
 Should ever catch the poet.
TRIAL  OF  MAJOR JOHN ANDRE.
Extracts of Letters from General Washington to
                            the President of Congress.
Robinson's House, in the Highlands, Sept. 26, 1780.

SIR,
I HAVE the honor to inform Congress, that I arrived here yesterday about
                            twelve o'clock, on my return from Hartford. Some hours previous to my
                            arrival, Major-General Arnold went from his quarters, which were this
                            place, and, as it was supposed, over the river to the garrison at
                            West-Point, whither I proceeded myself, in order to visit the post. I
                            found General Arnold had not been there during the day: and, on my
                            return to his quarters, he was still absent. In the mean time, a packet
                            had arrived from Lieut. Colonel Jameson, announcing the capture of a
                            John Anderson, who was endeavouring to go to New-York, with several
                            interesting and important papers, all in the hand-writing of General
                            Arnold. This was also accompanied with a letter from the prisoner,
                            avowing himself to be Major John André, Adjutant-General to the British
                            army, relating the manner of his capture, and endeavouring to shew that
                            he did not come under the description of a spy. From these several
                            circumstances, and information that the General seemed to be thrown into
                            some degree of agitation, on receiving a letter a little time before he
                            went from his quarters, I was led to conclude immediately that he had
                            heard of Major André's captivity, and that he would, if possible, escape
                            to the enemy; and accordingly took such measures as appeared the most
                            probable  to apprehend him. But he had embarked in a barge,
                            and proceeded down the river, under a flag, to the Vulture ship of war,
                            which lay at some miles below Stony and Verplanck's Points. He wrote me
                            a letter after he got on board. — Major André is not yet arrived, but I
                            hope he is secure, and that he will be here to-day. I have been, and am
                            taking precautions, which I trust will prove effectual, to prevent the
                            important consequences which this conduct, on the part of General
                            Arnold, was intended to produce. I do not know the party that took Major
                            André, but it is said that it consisted only of a few militia, who acted
                            in such a manner upon the occasion, as does them the highest honor, and
                            proves them to be men of great virtue. As soon as I know their names, I
                            shall take pleasure in transmitting them to Congress.

Paramus, October 7, 1780.
SIR,
I have the honor to enclose Congress a copy of the proceedings of a Board
                            of General Officers in the case of Major. André, Adjutant-General to the
                            British army. This officer was executed, in pursuance of the opinion of
                            the Board, on Monday, the 2d instant, at twelve o'clock, at our late
                            camp, at Tappan. Besides the proceedings, I transmit copies of sundry
                            letters respecting the matter, which are all that passed on the subject,
                            not included in the proceedings.
I have now the pleasure to communicate the names of the three persons who
                            captured Major André, and who refused to release him, notwithstanding
                            the most earnest importunities and assurances of a liberal reward on his
                            part. Their names are, John Paulding, David Williams
                            , and Isaac Van Wert.

Proceedings of a Board of General Officers, held by order of

                            Chief on the Army of the United States of America, respecting Major Ander , Adjutant-General of the British Army,
                            September the 29 th, 1780 , at
                            Tappan, in the State of New-York.
PRESENT.
MAJOR ANDRE, Adjutant-General to the British army, was brought before the
                            Board, and the following letter from General Washington to the Board,
                            dated Headquarters, Tappan, September 29, 1780, was laid before them,
                            and read.
Gentlemen,
Major André, Adjutant-General to the British army, will be brought before
                            you for your examination. He came within our lines in the night, on an
                            interview with Major-General Arnold, and in an assumed character, and
                            was taken within our lines, in a disguised habit, with a pass under a
                            seigned name, and with the enclosed papers concealed upon him. After a
                            careful examination, you will be pleased, as  speedily as
                            possible, to report a precise state of his case, together with your
                            opinion of the light in which he ought to be considered, and the
                            punishment that ought to be inflicted. The Judge-Advocate will attend to
                            assist in the examination, who has sundry other papers, relative to this
                            matter, which he will lay before the Board.
I have the honor to be, gentlemen,  Your most obedient and
                            humble servant,  G. WASHINGTON.
The Board of General Officers convened at Tappan.
The names of the officers composing the Board were read to Major André,
                            and on his being asked whether he confessed the matters contained in the
                            letter from his Excellency General Washington to the Board, or denied
                            them, he said, "in addition to his letter to General Washington, dated
                            Salem, the 24th September, 1780," which was read to the Board, and
                            acknowledged by Major André to have been written by him, which letter is
                            as follows:
Salem, September 24, 1780.

SIR,
WHAT I have as yet said concerning myself, was in the justifiable attempt
                            to be extricated; I am too little accustomed to duplicity to have
                            succeeded.
I beg your Excellency will be persuaded that no alteration in the temper
                            of my mind, or apprehension for my safety, induces me to take the step
                            of addressing you, but that it is to secure myself from an imputation of
                            having assumed a mean character, for treacherous purposes or
                            self-interest — A conduct incompatible with the principles that actuated
                            me, as well as with my condition in life.
It is to vindicate my fame that I speak, and not to solicit security.
The person in your possession is Major John André, Adjutant-General to
                            the British army.
The influence of one commander in the army of his adversary, is an
                            advantage taken in war. A correspondence  for this purpose I
                            held; as confidential (in the present instance) with his Excellency Sir
                            Henry Clinton.
To favor it, I agreed to meet upon ground not within posts of either
                            army, a person who was to give me intelligence I came up in the Vulture
                            man of war, for this effect, and was fetched, by a boat from the shore,
                            to the beach: Being there, I was told that the approach of day would
                            prevent my return, and that I must be concealed until the next night. I
                            was in my regimentals, and had fairly risked my person.
Against my stipulation, my intention, and without my knowledge before
                            hand, I was conducted within one of your posts. Your Excellency may
                            conceive my sensation on this occasion, and will imagine how much more I
                            must have been affected, by a refusal to reconduct me back the next
                            night, as I had been brought. Thus become a prisoner, I had to concert
                            my escape. I quitted my uniform , was passed another
                            way in the night without the American posts to neutral ground, and
                            informed I was beyond all armed parties, and left to press for New-York.
                            I was taken at Tarry-Town by some volunteers.
Thus, as I have had the honor to relate, was I betrayed (being
                            Adjutant-General of the British army) into the vile condition of an
                            enemy in disguise within your posts.
Having avowed myself a British officer, I have nothing to reveal but what
                            relates to myself, which is true on the honor of an officer and a
                            gentleman.
The request I have to make your Excellency, and I am conscious I address
                            myself well, is, that in any rigor policy may dictate, a decency of
                            conduct towards me may mark, that though unfortunate, I am branded with
                            nothing dishonorable, as no motive could be mine but the service of my
                            King, and as I was involuntarily an impostor.
Another request is, that I may be permitted to write an open letter to
                            Sir Henry Clinton, and another to a friend for clothes and linen.
I take the liberty to mention the condition of some gentlemen at
                            Charleston, who being either on parole or under  protection,
                            were engaged in a conspiracy against us. Tho' their situation is not
                            similar, they are objects who may be set in exchange for me, or are
                            persons whom the treatment I receive might affect.
It is no less, Sir, in a confidence in the generosity of your mind, than
                            on account of your superior station, that I have chosen to importune you
                            with this letter.
I have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir,  Your
                            Excellency's most obedient,  and most humble servant,  JOHN
                            ANDRE, Adjutant-General.
His Excellency General Washington, &amp;.mp;c. &amp;.mp;c. &amp;.mp;c.
That he came on shore from the Vulture sloop of war, in the night of the
                            twenty-first of September instant, somewhere under the Haverstraw
                            Mountain: That the boat he came on shore in carried no flag; and that he
                            had on a surtout coat over his regimentals, and that he wore his surtout
                            coat when he was taken: That he met General Arnold on the shore, and had
                            an interview with him there. He also said, that when he left the Vulture
                            sloop of war, it was understood that he was to return that night; but it
                            was then doubted, and if he could not return, he was promised to be
                            concealed on shore in a place of safety, until the next night, when he
                            was to return in the same manner he came on shore; and when the next day
                            came, he was solicitous to get back, and made inquiries in the course of
                            the day how he should return, when he was informed he could not return
                            that way, and he must take the route he did afterwards. He also said,
                            that the first notice he had of his being within any of our posts, was,
                            being challenged by the sentry, which was the first night he was on
                            shore. He also said, that the evening of the twenty-second of September
                            instant, he passed King's-Ferry, between our posts of Stony and
                            Verplanck's Points, in the dress he is at present in, and which he said
                            was not his regimentals, and which dress he procured, after he landed
                            from the Vulture, and when he was within our post; and that he was
                            proceeding to New-York, but was taken on his  way at
                            Tarry-Town, as he has mentioned in his letter, on Saturday the
                            twenty-third of September instant, about nine o'clock in the
                            morning.
The following papers were laid before the Board and shewn to Major André,
                            who confessed to the Board, that they were found on him when he was
                            taken, and said they were concealed in his boot, except the pass: — — 
A pass from General Arnold to John Anderson, which name Major André
                            acknowledged he assumed.

A letter signed John Anderson , dated September 7,
                            1780, to Colonel Sheldon, [Footnote: 1Kb
                            Lest it should be supposed that Col. Sheldon, to
                                whom the above letter is addressed, was privy to the plot carrying
                                on by General Arnold, it is to be observed, that the letter was
                                found among Arnold's papers, and had been transmitted by Colonel
                                Sheldon, who, it appears from a letter of the 9th of September to
                                Arnold, which inclosed it, had never heard of John Anderson before.
                                Arnold, in his answer on the 10th, acknowledged he had not
                                communicated it to him, though he had informed him that he expected
                                a person would come from New-York, for the purpose of bringing him
                                intelligence. was also laid before the Board, and shewn to
                            Major André, which he acknowledged to have been
                            written by him , and is as follows:

New-York, the 7th Sept . 1780.
SIR,
I AM told my name is made known to you, and that I
                            may hope your indulgence in permitting me to meet a friend near your
                            out-posts. I will endeavour to obtain permission to go out with a flag , which will be sent to Dobb's Ferry on
                            Monday next, the 11th, at twelve o'clock, when I shall  be
                            happy to meet Mr. G---. [Footnote: 1Kb
                            It appears by the same letter, that Arnold had
                                written to Mr. Anderson under the signature of Gustavus. His words
                                are "I was obliged to write with great caution to him, my letter was
                                signed Gustavus, to prevent any discovery, in case it fell into the
                                hands of the enemy." Should I not be allowed to go, the
                            officer who is to command the escort, between whom and myself no
                            distinction need be made, can speak on the affair.
Let me intreat you, Sir, to favor a matter so interesting to the parties
                            concerned, and which is of so private a nature, that the public on
                            neither side can be injured by it.
I shall be happy on my part in doing any act of kindness to you, in a
                            family or property concern of a similar nature.
I trust I shall not be detained, but should any old grudge be a cause for
                            it, I shall rather risk that, than neglect the business in question, or assume a mysterious character to carry on an
                            innocent affair, and, as friends have advised, get to your lines by
                            stealth. I am, Sir, with all regard,
Your most obedient humble servant,
JOHN ANDERSON.
Col. Sheldon.
Major André observed that this letter could be of no force in the case in
                            question, as it was written in New-York, when he was under the orders of
                            General Clinton; but that it tended to prove that it was not his
                            intention to come within our lines.
The Board having interrogated Major André about his conception of his
                            coming on shore under the fanction of a flag, he said, that it was impossible for him to suppose he came on shore under
                                that sanction ; and added, that if he came on shore under that
                            sanction, he certainly might have returned under it.
Major André having acknowledged the preceding facts, and being asked
                            whether he had any thing to say respecting them, answered, he left them
                            to operate with the Board.
The examination of Major André being concluded, he was remanded into
                            custody.
The following letters were laid before the Board, and read: — Benedict
                            Arnold's letter to General Washington, dated September 25, 1780; Colonel
                            Robinson's letter to General Washington, dated September 25, 1780; and
                            General Clinton's letter, dated 26th September, 1780, (inclosing a
                            letter of the same date from Benedict Arnold) to General Washington.
On board the Vulture, Sept. 25,
                                1780.

SIR,
THE heart which is conscious of its own rectitude, cannot attempt to
                            palliate a step which the world may censure as wrong; I have ever acted
                            from a principle of love to my country, since the commencement of the
                            present unhappy contest between Great-Britain and the colonies; the same
                            principle of love to my country actuates my present conduct, however it
                            may appear inconsistent to the world, who very seldom judge right of any
                            man's actions.
I have no favor to ask for myself. I have too often experienced the
                            ingratitude of my country to attempt it; but from the known humanity of
                            your Excellency, I am induced to ask your protection for Mrs. Arnold,
                            from every insult and injury that the mistaken vengeance of my country
                            may expose her to. It ought to fall only on me; she is as good and as
                            innocent as an angel, and is incapable of doing wrong. I beg she may be
                            permitted to return to her friends in Philadelphia, or to come to me, as
                            she may choose; from your Excellency I have no fears on her account, but
                            she may suffer from the mistaken fury of the country.
I have to request that the inclosed letter may be delivered to Mrs.
                            Arnold, and she permitted to write to me.
I have also to ask that my clothes and baggage, which are of little
                            consequence, may be sent to me; if required, their value shall be paid
                            for in money.
I have the honor to be, with great regard and esteem, 
                            Your Excellency's most obedient humble servant,  B. ARNOLD.
His Excellency General Washington.
N.B. In justice to the gentlemen of my family, Colonel Varick and Major
                            Franks, I think myself in honor bound to declare, that they, as well as
                            Joshua Smith, Esq. (who I know is suspected) are totally ignorant of any
                            transactions of mine, that they had reason to believe were injurious to
                            the public.
Vulture, off Sinsinck, Sept. 25,
                                1780.

SIR,
I AM this moment informed that Major André, Adjutant-General of his
                            Majesty's army in America, is detained as a prisoner by the army under
                            your command: it is, therefore, incumbent on me to inform you of the
                            manner of his falling into your hands. He went up with a flag at the
                            request of General Arnold, on public business with him, and had his
                            permit to return by land to New-York. Under these circumstances Major
                            André cannot be detained by you, without the greatest violation of
                            flags, and contrary to the custom and usage of all nations; and, as I
                            imagine you will see this matter in the same point of view as I do, I
                            must desire that you will order him to be set at liberty, and allowed to
                            return immediately. Every step Major André took was by the advice and
                            direction of General Arnold, even that of taking a feigned name, and of
                            course not liable to censure for it.
I am, Sir, not forgetting former acquaintance,  Your very
                            humble servant,  BEV. ROBINSON, Col. Loyal Americans.
His Excellency General Washington.
New-York, Sept. 26, 1780.

SIR,
BEING informed that the King's Adjutant-General in America has been stopt
                            under Major-General Arnold's passports, and is detained a prisoner in
                            your Excellency's army, I have the honor to inform you, Sir, that I
                            permitted Major André to go to Major-General Arnold, at the particular
                            request of that general officer. You will perceive, Sir, by the inclosed
                            paper, that a flag of truce was sent to receive Major André, and
                            passports granted for his  return: I therefore can have no
                            doubt but your Excellency will immediately direct, that this officer has
                            permission to return to my orders at New-York.
I have the honor to be, your Excellency's  most obedient
                            and most humble servant.  H. CLINTON.
His Excellency General Washington.
New-York. Sept. 26, 1780.

SIR,
IN answer to your Excellency's message, respecting your Adjutant-General,
                            Major André, and desiring my idea of the reasons why he is detained,
                            being under my passports, I have the honor to inform you, Sir, that I
                            apprehend a few hours must return Major André to your Excellency's
                            orders, as that officer is assuredly under the protection of a flag of
                            truce sent by me to him, for the purpose of a conversation which I
                            requested to hold with him relating to myself, and which I wished to
                            communicate through that officer to your Excellency.
I commanded at the time at West-Point, had an undoubted right to send my
                            flag of truce for Major André, who came to me under that protection, and
                            having held my conversation with him, I delivered him confidential
                            papers in my own hand-writing, to deliver to your Excellency. Thinking
                            it much properer he should return by land, I directed him to make use of
                            the feigned name of John Anderson, under which he had, by my direction,
                            come on shore, and gave him my passports to go to the White Plains, on
                            his way to New-York. This officer cannot therefore fail of being
                            immediately sent to New-York, as he was invited to a conversation with
                            me, for which I sent him a flag of truce, and finally gave him passports
                            for his safe return to your Excellency; all which I had then a right to
                            do, being in the actual service of America, under the orders of General
                            Washington, and commanding general at West-Point and its
                            dependencies.
I have the honor to be, your Excellency's  most obedient
                            and very humble servant,
His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.
B.ARNOLD.
The Board having considered the letter from his Excellency General
                            Washington respecting Major André, Adjutant-General to the British army,
                            the confession of Major André, and the papers produced to them, REPORT
                            to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, the following facts, which
                            appear to them relative to Major André.
First, That he came on shore from the Vulture sloop of war, in the night
                            of the twenty-first of September instant, on an interview with General
                            Arnold, in a private and secret manner.
Secondly, That he changed his dress within our lines, and under a feigned
                            name, and in a disguised habit, passed our works at Stony and
                            Verplanck's Points, the evening of the twenty-second of September
                            instant, and was taken the morning of the twenty-third of September
                            instant, at Tarry-Town, in a disguised habit, being then on his way to
                            New-York; and when taken, he had in his possession several papers, which
                            contained intelligence for the enemy.
The Board having maturely considered these facts, Do ALSO REPORT to his
                            Excellency General Washington, that Major André, Adjutant-General to the
                            British army, ought to be considered as a Spy from the enemy, and that
                            agreeable to the law and usage of nations, it is their opinion, he ought
                            to suffer death.
APPENDIX.
Copy of a Letter from Major André, Adjutant-General, to
                            Sir Henry Clinton, K.B. &amp;.mp;c.&amp;.mp;c.
Tappan, Sept 29, 1780.

SIR,

Your Excellency is doubtless already apprized of the
                            manner in which I was taken, and possibly of the serious light in which
                            my conduct is considered, and the rigorous determination that is
                            impending.
Under these circumstances, I have obtained General Washington's
                            permission to send you this letter; the object of which is, to remove
                            from your breast any suspicion, that I could imagine I was bound by your
                            Excellency's orders to expose myself to what has happened. The events of
                            coming within an enemy's posts, and of changing my dress, which led me
                            to my present situation, were contrary to my own intentions, as they
                            were to your orders; and the circutous route, which I took to return,
                            was imposed (perhaps unavoidably) without alternative upon me.
I am perfectly tranquil in mind, and prepared for any fate to which an
                            honest zeal for my King's service may have devoted me.
In addressing myself to your Excellency on this occasion, the force of
                            all my obligations to you, and of the attachment and gratitude I bear
                            you, recurs to me. With all the warmth of my heart, I give you thanks
                            for your Excellency's profuse kindness to me; and I send you the most
                            earnest wishes for your welfare, which a faithful, affectionate, and
                            respectful attendant can frame.
I have a mother and three sisters, to whom the value of my commission
                            would be an object, as the loss of Grenada has much affected their
                            income. It is needless to be more explicit on this subject; I am
                            persuaded of your Excellency's goodness.
I receive the greatest attention from his Excellency General Washington,
                            and from every person under whose charge I happen to be placed.
I have the honor to be,  With the most respectful
                            attachment,  Your Excellency's most obedient,  and most humble
                            servant,
(Addressed)   JOHN ANDRE, Adjutant-General.
His Excellency Gen. Sir Henry Clinton, K. B.&amp;.mp;c. &amp;.mp;c.
Copy of a Letter from his Excellency General Washington, to
                            his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.
Head-Quarters, Sept. 30, 1780.

SIR,
IN answer to your Excellency's letter of the 26th instant, which I had
                            the honor to receive, I am to inform you, that Major André was taken
                            under such circumstances as would have justified the most summary
                            proceedings against him. I determined, however, to refer his case to the
                            examination and decision of a Board of General Officers, who have
                            reported, on his free and voluntary confession and letters, "That he
                            came on shore from the Vulture sloop of war, in the night of the
                            twenty-first of September instant," &amp;.mp;c. &amp;.mp;c. as in the report of the
                            Board of General Officers.
From these proceedings, it is evident Major André was employed in the
                            execution of measures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and
                            such as they were never meant to authorise or countenance in the most
                            distant degree; and this gentleman confessed, with the greatest candor,
                            in the course of his examination, "That it was impossible for him to
                            suppose he came on shore under the sanction of a flag."
I have the honor to be your Excellency's  Most obedient
                            and most humble servant,
(Addressed)   G. WASHINGTON.
His Excellency Sir Henry Clinton.
In this letter, Major André's of the 29th of September to Sir Henry
                            Clinton was transmitted.
New-York, 29 th Sept. 1780.

SIR,
PERSUADED that you are inclined rather to promote than prevent the
                            civilities and acts of humanity, which the rules of war permit between
                            civilized nations, I find no difficulty in representing to you, that
                            several letters and messages sent from hence have been disregarded, are
                            unanswered, and the flags of truce that carried them, detained. As I
                            have ever treated all flags of truce with civility and respect, I have a
                            right to hope, that you will order my complaint to be immediately
                            redressed.
Major André, who visited an officer commanding in a district at his own
                            desire, and acted in every circumstance agreeable to his direction, I
                            find is detained a prisoner; my friendship for him leads me to fear he
                            may suffer some inconvenience for want of necessaries; I wish to be
                            allowed to send him a few, and shall take it as a favor if you will be
                            pleased to permit his servant to deliver them. In Sir Henry Clinton's
                            absence, it becomes a part of my duty to make this representation and
                            request.
I am, Sir, your Excellency's  Most obedient humble
                            servant,  JAMES ROBERTSON, Lieutenant-General.
His Excellency General Washington.

Tappan, Sept. 30, 1780.
SIR,
I HAVE just received your letter of the 29th. Any delay which may have
                            attended your flags, has proceeded from accident and the peculiar
                            circumstances of the occasion, not from intentional neglect or
                            violation. The letter that admitted of an answer, has received one as
                            early as it could be given with propriety, transmitted by a flag this
                            morning. As to messages, I am uninformed of any that have been sent.
The necessaries for Major André will be delivered to him, agreeable to
                            your request.
I am, Sir,  Your most obedient humble servant,  G.
                            WASHINGTON.
His Excellency Lieut. Gen. Robertson, New-York.
New-York, Sept. 30, 1780.

SIR,
FROM your Excellency's letter of this date, I am persuaded the Board of
                            General Officers, to whom you referred the case of Major André, cannot
                            have been rightly informed of all the circumstances on which a judgment
                            ought to be formed. I think it of the highest moment to humanity, that
                            your Excellency should be perfectly apprized of the state of this
                            matter, before you proceed to put that judgment in execution.
For this reason, I send his Excellency Lieutenant-General Roberson, and
                            two other gentlemen, to give you a true state of facts, and to declare
                            to you my sentiments and resolutions. They will set out to-morrow, as
                            early as the wind and tide will permit, and wait near Dobb's Ferry for
                            your permission and safe conduct, to meet your Excellency, or such
                            persons as you may appoint, to converse with them on this subject.
I have the honor to be your Excellency's  Most obedient
                            and most humble servant,  H. CLINTON.
P. S. The Hon. Andrew Elliot, Esq. Lieutenant-Governor, and the Hon.
                            William Smith, Chief-Justice of this provicne, will attend his
                            Excellency Lieutenant-General Robertson.
H. C.
His Excellency General Washington.
Lieut. General Robertson, Mr. Elliot, and Mr. Smith, came up in a flag
                            vessel to Dobb's Ferry, agreeable to the above letter. The two last were
                            not suffered to land. General Robertson was permitted to come on shore,
                            and was met by Major-General Greeue, who verbally reported that General
                            Robertson mentioned to him in substance what is contained in his letter
                            of the 2d of October to General Washington.
New-York, October 1, 1780.

SIR,
I TAKE this opportunity to inform your Excellency, that I consider myself
                            no longer acting under the commission  of Congress: Their
                            last to me being among my papers at West-Point, you, Sir, will make such
                            use of it as you think proper.
At the same time, I beg leave to assure your Excellency, that my
                            attachment to the true interest of my country is invariable, and that I
                            am actuated by the same principle which has ever
                            been the governing rule of my conduct, in this
                            unhappy contest.
I have the honor to be, very respectfully,  Your
                            Excellency's most obedient humble servant,  B. ARNOLD.
His Excellency General Washington.
Greyhound Schooner, Flag of Truce.
Dobb's Ferry, Oct. 2, 1780.

SIR
A NOTE I have from General Greene, leaves me in doubt if his memory had
                            served him to relate to you, with exactness, the substance of the
                            conversation that had passed between him and myself, on the subject of
                            Major André. In an affair of so much consequence to my friend, to the
                            two armies, and humanity, I would leave no possibility of a
                            misunderstanding, and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the
                            substance of what I said to General Greene.
I offered to prove, by the evidence of Colonel Robinson, and the officers
                            of the Vulture, that Major André went on shore at General Arnold's
                            desie, in a boat sent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only
                            came ashor with the knowledge, and under the protection of the general
                            who commanded in the district, but that he took no step, while on shore,
                            but by the direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the inclosed
                            letter from him to your Excellency. Under these circumstances I could
                            not, and hoped you would not, consider Major André as spy, for any
                            improper phrase in his letter to you.
The facts he relates correspond with the evidence I offer; but he admits
                            a conclusion that does not follow. The change of clothes and name was
                            ordered by General Arnold, under whose direction he necessarily was,
                            while within his command.  As General Greene and I did not
                            agree in opinion, I wished that disinterested gentlemen of knowledge of
                            the law of war and nations, might he asked their opinion on the subject,
                            and mentioned Monsieur Knyphausen and General Rochambault.
I related that a Captain Robinson had been delivered to Sir Henry Clinton
                            as a spy, and undoubtedly was such; but that it being signified to him
                            that you were desirous that this man should be exchanged, he had ordered
                            him to be exchanged.
I wished that an intercourse of such civilities as the rules of war admit
                            of, might take off many of its horrors. I admitted that Major André had
                            a great share of Sir Henry Clinton's esteem, and that he would be
                            infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to
                            return with me, I would engage to have any person you would be pleased
                            to name, set at liberty.
I added, that Sir Henry Clinton had never put to death any person for a
                            breach of the rules of war, though he had, and now has, many in his
                            power. Under the present circumstances, much good may arise from
                            humanity, much ill from the want of it. If that could give any weight, I
                            beg leave to add, that your favorable treatment of Major André will be a
                            favor I should ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.
My memory does not retain with the exactness I could wish, the words of
                            the letter which General Greene shewed me from Major André to your
                            Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's satisfaction, I beg you will order a
                            copy of it to be sent to me at New-York.
I have the honor to be your Excellency's  Most obedient,
                            and most humble servant,  JAMES ROBERTSON.
His Excellency General Washington.
New-York, October 1, 1780.

SIR,
THE polite attention shewn by your Excellency and the gentlemen of your
                            family to Mrs. Arnold, when in distress,  demands my
                            grateful acknowledgment and thanks, which I beg leave to present.
From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a board of
                            general officers have given it as their opinion, that Major André comes
                            under the description of a spy. My good opinion of the candor and
                            justice of those gentlemen leads me to believe, that if they had been
                            made fully acquainted with every circumstance respecting Major André,
                            that they would by no means have considered him in the light of a spy,
                            or even of a prisoner. In justice to him, I think it my duty to declare,
                            that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular request, by a
                            flag sent on purpose for him by Joshua Smith, Esq. who had permission to
                            go to Dobb's Ferry, to carry letters, and for other purposes not
                            mentioned, and to return. This was done as a blind to the spy boats. Mr.
                            Smith at the same time had my private instructions to go on board the
                            Vulture, and bring on shore Colonel Robinson, or Mr. John Anderson,
                            which was the name I had requested Major André to assume: at the same
                            time I desired Mr. Smith to inform him that he should have my
                            protection, and a safe passport to return in the same boat, as soon as
                            our business was completed. As several accidents intervened to prevent
                            his being sent on board, I gave him my passport to return by land. Major
                            André came on shore in his uniform (without disguise), which, with much
                            reluctance, at my particular and pressing instance, he exchanged for
                            another coat. I furnished him with a horse and saddle, and pointed out
                            the route by which he was to return. And, as commanding officer in the
                            department, I had an undoubted right to transact all these matters,
                            which, if wrong, Major André ought by no means to suffer for them.
But if, after this just and candid representation of Major André's case,
                            the board of general officers adhere to their former opinion, I shall
                            suppose it dictated by passion and resentment; and if that gentleman
                            should suffer the severity of their sentence, I shall think myself
                            bound, by every tie of  duty and honor, to retaliate on
                            such unhappy persons of your army as may fall within my power, that the
                            respect due to flags, and to the law of nations, may be better
                            understood and observed.
I have further to observe, that forty of the principal inhabitants of
                            South-Carolina have justly forfeited their lives, which have hitherto
                            been spared by the clemency of his Excellency Sir Henry Clinton, who
                            cannot in justice extend his mercy to them any longer, if Major André
                            suffers; which, in all probability, will open a scene of blood at which
                            humanity will revolt.
Suffer me to intreat your Excellency for your own and the honor of
                            humanity, and the love you have of justice, that you suffer not an
                            unjust sentence to touch the life of Major Andre.
But if this warning should be disregarded, and he suffer, I call heaven
                            and earth to witness, that your Excellency will be justly answerable for
                            the torrent of blood that may be spilt in consequence.
I have the honor to be, with due respect,  Your
                            Excellency's most obedient,  and very humble servant,  B.
                            ARNOLD.
His Excellency General Washington.
Tappan, October 1, 1780.

SIR,
BUOY'D above the terror of death, by the consciousness of a life devoted
                            to honorable pursuits, and stained with no action that can give me
                            remorse, I trust that the request I make to your Excellency at this
                            serious period, and which is to soften my last moments, will not be
                            rejected.
Sympathy towards a soldier will surely induce your Excellency and a
                            military tribunal, to adapt the mode of my death to the feelings of a
                            man of honor.
Let me hope, Sir, that if aught in my character impresses you with esteem
                            towards me, if aught in my misfortunes marks me as the victim of policy
                            and not of resentment, I  shall experience the operation of
                            these feelings in your breast, by being informed that I am not to die on
                            a gibbet.
I have the honor to be your Excellency's  Most obedient,
                            and most humble servant,  JOHN ANDRE, Adj. Gen. to the British
                            army.
His Excellency General Washington.
The time which elapsed between the capture of Major André, which was on
                            the morning of the 23d of September, and his execution, which did not
                            take place till twelve o'clock on the second of October; the mode of
                            trying him; his letter to Sir Henry Clinton, K. B. on the 29th of
                            September, in which he said, "I receive the greatest attention from his
                            Excellency General Washington, and from every person under whose charge
                            I happen to be placed;" not to mention many other acknowledgments which
                            he made of the good treatment he received; must evince that the
                            proceedings against him were not guided by passion or resentment. The
                            practice and usage of war were against his request, and made the
                            indulgence he solicited, circumstanced as he was, inadmissible.

                            CHARLES THOMSON , Secretary.
EXTRACT from a LETTER which appeared in the Pennsylvania Gazette, dated
                            October 25, 1780. The Author supposed to be Colonel
                                Hamilton , Aid-de-Camp to General Washington.

Never , perhaps, did a man suffer death with more
                            justice, or deserve it less. The first step he took after his capture
                            was to write a letter to General Washington, conceived in terms of
                            dignity without insolence, and apology without meanness. The scope of it
                            was to vindicate himself from the imputation of having assumed a mean
                            character, for treacherous or interested purposes; that, contrary to his
                            intention, which was to meet a person for intelligence, on neutral
                            ground, he had been betrayed within our posts, and forced into the vile
                            condition of an enemy in disguise; soliciting only, that to whatever
                            rigour policy might devote him, a decency of treatment might be observed
                            due to a person who, though unfortunate, had been guilty of nothing
                            dishonorable. His request was granted in its full extent; for, in the
                            whole progress of the affair, he was treated with the most scrupulous
                            delicacy. When brought before the Board of Officers, he met with every
                            mark of indulgence, and was required to answer no interrogatory which
                            could embarrass his feelings. On his part, while he carefully concealed
                            every thing that might involve others, he frankly confessed all the
                            facts relative to himself; and, upon his confession, without the trouble
                            of examining a witness, the Board made their report. The members of it
                            were not more impressed with the candour and modest firmness, mixed with
                            a becoming sensibility, which he displayed, than he was penetrated with
                            their liberality and politeness. He acknowledged the generosity of the
                            behaviour towards him in every respect, but particularly in this, in the
                            strongest terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation with a gentleman
                            who visited him after his trial, he said, he flattered himself he had
                            never been illiberal; but if there were  any remains of
                            prejudice in his mind, his present experience must obliterate them.
In one of the visits I made to him (and I saw him several times during
                            his confinement) he begged me to be the bearer of a request to the
                            General, for permission to send an open letter to Sir Henry Clinton. "I
                            foresee my fate," said he, "and though I pretend not to play the hero,
                            or to be indifferent about life, yet I am reconciled to whatever may
                            happen, conscious that misfortune, not guilt, will have brought it upon
                            me. There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir Henry
                            Clinton has been too good to me; he has been lavish of his kindness. I
                            am bound to him by too many obligations, and love him too well, to bear
                            the thought that he should reproach himself, or that others should
                            reproach him, on a supposition that I had conceived myself obliged by
                            his instructions to run the risk I did. I would not for the world leave
                            a sting in his mind that should embitter his future days." He could
                            scarce finish the sentence, bursting into tears in spite of his efforts
                            to suppress them, and with difficulty collected himself enough
                            afterwards to add, "I wish to be permitted to assure him I did not act
                            under this impression, but submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as
                            contrary to my own inclination as to his orders." — His request was
                            readily complied with, and he wrote the letter annexed, with which I
                            dare say you will be as much pleased as I am, both for the diction and
                            sentiment.
When his sentence was announced to him, he remarked, that since it was
                            his lot to die, as there was a choice in the mode, which would make
                            material difference to his feelings, he would be happy, if it were
                            possible to be indulged with a professional death. He made a second
                            application by letter, in concise but persuasive terms. It was thought
                            this indulgence, being incompatible with the customs of war, could not
                            be granted; and it was therefore determined in both cases to evade an
                            answer, to spare him the sensations which a certain knowledge of the
                            intended mode would inflict.
When he was led out to the place of execution, as he went along, he bowed
                            familiarly to all those with whom he had been acquainted in his
                            confinement. A smile of complacency expressed the serene fortitude of
                            his mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he asked, with emotion, "Must I
                            then die in this manner?" He was told it had been unavoidable. "I am
                            reconciled to my fate," said he, "but not to the mode." Soon, however,
                            recollecting himself, he added, "It will be but a momentary pang;" and,
                            springing upon the cart, performed the last offices to himself, with a
                            composure that excited the admiration, and melted the hearts of the
                            beholders. Upon being told the final moment was at hand, and asked if he
                            had any thing to say, he answered, "Nothing, but to request you will
                            witness to the world that I die like a brave man." Among the
                            extraordinary circumstances that attended him, in the midst of his
                            enemies, he died universally esteemed, and universally regretted.
There was something singularly interesting in the character and fortunes
                            of André. To an excellent understanding, well improved by education and
                            travel, he united a peculiar elegance of mind and manners, and the
                            advantage of a pleasing person. It is said he possessed a pretty taste
                            for the fine arts, and had himself attained some proficiency in poetry,
                            music and painting. His knowledge appeared without ostentation, and
                            embellished by a diffidence that rarely accompanies so many talents and
                            accomplishments, which left you to suppose more than appeared. His
                            sentiments were elevated, and inspired esteem; they had a softness that
                            conciliated affection. His elocution was handsome; his address easy,
                            polite, and infinuating. By his merit he had acquired the confidence of
                            his General, and was making a rapid progress in military rank and
                            reputation. But in the height of his career, flushed with new hopes from
                            the execution of a project, the most beneficial to his party that could
                            be devised, he is at once precipitated from the summit of prosperity,
                            sees all the expectations of his ambition blasted, and himself
                            ruined.
The character I have given of him is drawn partly from what I saw of him
                            myself, and partly from information. I am aware that a man of real merit
                            is never seen in so favorable a light, as through the medium of
                            adversity. The clouds that surround him are so many shadows that set off
                            his good qualities. Misfortune cuts down little vanities, that, in
                            prosperous times, serve as so many spots in his virtues, and gives a
                            tone of humility that makes his worth more amiable. His spectators, who
                            enjoyed a happier lot, are less prone to detract from its true envy; and
                            are more disposed by compassion to give him the credit he deserves, and
                            perhaps even to magnify it.
I speak not to Andre's conduct in this affair as a philosopher, but as a
                            man of the world. The authorized maxims and practices of war are the
                            sators of human nature. They countenance almost every species of
                            seduction as well as violence; and the general who can make most
                            traitors in the army of his adversary, is frequently most applauded. On
                            this scale we acquit Andre. while we could not but condemn him if we
                            were to examine his conduct by the sober rules of philosophy and moral
                            rectitude.
                    
                    THE END.
