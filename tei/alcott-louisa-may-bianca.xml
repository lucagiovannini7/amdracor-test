    NOTE TO BIANCA.
   </head>
   <p>
    The peculiarity of this opera was that while the words were committed to memory, the music was composed and sung as the scene proceeded.
   </p>
   <p>
    In spite of its absurdity, this play was a great favorite; for Jo was truly superb as the hapless Bianca, while her trills and tragic agonies were considered worthy of the famous Grisi herself.
