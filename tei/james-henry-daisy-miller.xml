    EDITOR'S FOREWORD
   </head>
   <p>
    Henry James was thirty-eight when he returned to the United States in the autumn of 1881 after an absence of six years. He had gone abroad at thirty-two a "promising" novelist. He returned with a substantial literary reputation. The stay abroad had been fruitful. He had written in succession The American, The Europeans, An International Episode, Daisy Miller, Confidence, Washington Square, The Portrait of a Lady , assembled several volumes of tales, published French Poets and Novelists and his study of Hawthorne, in addition to many fugitive pieces for the magazines.
   </p>
   <p>
    Daisy Miller , first published in the Cornhill Magazine , had been, as James wrote his mother, "a really quite extraordinary hit" and was the story to which his name remained attached, in the public mind, even long after he had done much more important work. A slender little tale, its interest centered in the personality of his heroine and the frosty expatriate appropriately named Winterbourne. The story aroused controversy: had James maligned the American girl in creating the portrait of an innocent little flirt, a fresh daisy in a European garden filled with jaded blooms? James himself said that the "whole idea of the story is the little tragedy of a light, thin, natural, unsuspecting creature being sacrificed as it were to a social rumpus that went on quite over her head and to which she stood in no measurable relation."
   </p>
   <p>
    The story was not dramatic in the sense of the theatre; but there was a drama latent in it. We do not know whether the idea of dramatization originated with James or the management of the Madison Square Theatre. The theatre, the most modern in New York, had been rebuilt in 1879 by Steele Mackaye backed by the Mallory brothers, one a clergyman, with an interest in the stage and with adequate means to cultivate it. The manager of the theatre, for the Mallorys, was Daniel Frohman, who recalled that James, "a medium-sized man with a beard" who looked like "an ordinary business man," brought him the play. He said he rejected it because, although it was "beautifully written," it was "too literary. It had too much talk and not enough action." James, however, must have also carried on negotiations with the Mallory brothers themselves, since he speaks in his journal of the proprietors who "behaved like asses and sharpers combined," adding "this episode, by itself, would make a brilliant chapter in a realistic novel." There is an allusion to the episode in a letter from William Dean Howells to James who, in describing his own troubled relations with the Madison Square Theatre, said, "When we meet, I will tell you how those gifted brothers led me on protesting over the same path you trod to the same flowery pitfall, with another play. I really begin to admire them; they are masters of no common skill."
   </p>
   <p>
    Whatever the details of the transaction, it is clear that the entire affair left a deep impression on James. In a letter to Charles Brookfield, the actor, he said only that "the manager and I fell out ... and I returned to England with my comedy in my pocket," and to Mrs. John L. Gardner he put it: "I had a fundamental disagreement with the manager and got it back just before sailing." But this fundamental disagreement is described in his journal some months later as inspiring "deep and unspeakable disgust"; James wrote that "what it has brought [me] to know, both in New York and in London about the manners and ideas of managers and actors and about the conditions of productions on our unhappy stage, is almost fatally disgusting and discouraging. I have learned very vividly that if one attempts to work for it one must be prepared for disgust . ..."
   </p>
   <p>
    It is unfortunate that the details are lost to us, for they might indicate, more clearly than the later experiences, what the original set-back and rejection were which so conditioned his attitude of anger and defiance toward the theatre. Allowance must be made for the possibility, however, that the managers quite simply took an option on the play and then lost interest in it, as so often happens in the theatre; and that James, unaccustomed to the "tough" realities of "show business," reacted sharply.
   </p>
   <p>
    His memory of the writing of the play was somewhat pleasanter, and he looked back upon this period with "a kind of religious veneration." He wrote it in Boston during the three months that followed the death of his mother in January 1882. He lived in bare, ugly rooms in Mount Vernon Street which he nevertheless found comfortable and pleasant. He would walk across the Common in the morning and take his breakfast at Parker's. Then he would return to his lodgings and write until late afternoon, after which he would walk out to Cambridge, four or five days in the week, to the Quincy Street residence of the James family, there to dine with his father and sister. In the evening, under the winter stars and past the colored lamps, he would walk back along the dark and vacant roads listening to the jingle of the horse-cars. His thoughts dwelt constantly on his mother.
   </p>
   <p>
    When he had completed the play he read it to the Boston socialite, Mrs. John L. Gardner. With the elaborate irony which characterizes all his letters to her, Henry James wrote on June 5, 1882: "I think with extraordinary tenderness of those two pretty little evenings when I read you my play. They make a charming picture — a perfect picture — in my mind, and the memory of them appeals to all that is most raffiné in my constitution. Drop a tear — a diminutive tear (as your tears must be — small but beautifully-shaped pearls) upon the fact that my drama is not after all to be brought out in New York (at least for the present). ... It is possible it may see the light here. I am to read it to the people of the St. James's Theatre next week. Please don't speak of this ."
   </p>
   <p>
    We know that he tried to enlist the interest of Charles Brookfield and had hopes that the Bancrofts would do the play at the Haymarket, but nothing came of this. In the autumn of the year he had the play privately printed in order to circulate it more easily among the London managers. The following spring he published it in the Atlantic Monthly — in the issues of April, May and June — and later that year it appeared in book form under the imprint of James R. Osgood, after it had been rejected by Houghton and Mifflin. James made some minor revisions in the play between its private printing and its publication.
   </p>
   <p>
    The play rewrites the original story considerably. Eugenio, the courier of the tale, becomes the villain of the piece and the shadowy lady in Geneva, briefly alluded to in the story as the friend of Winterbourne, becomes the all-important Madame de Katkoff of the play. In the tale Daisy dies of malaria and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome. In the play we are left with the promise of an early marriage between Daisy and Winterbourne. In transferring the tale to the dramatic form its freshness is lost and a rather artificial comedy is substituted which, for all its defects, reveals its author's skill in dialogue and characterization, but as yet considerable amateurishness in the manipulation of his personages and the handling of stage business. The New York Tribune devoted two columns to the book, dismissing it as a "highly impossible comedy" and adding, "we cannot repress some surprise — and regret — that such an accomplished writer and acute critic should not have perceived the full extent of the failure which he has now put permanently on record."
   </p>

    A NOTE ON THE TEXTS
   </head>
   <p>
    In assembling the plays of Henry James for publication, over a period of two decades, the editor was able to collate thirty-three texts of six of the seven hitherto unpublished plays (the seventh being Summersoft of which only one text appears to be extant). The corrections and emendations were such as occur in the progress of a modern play from the dramatist's desk, through the production office into the theatre. James was called upon to revise his plays many times; typed copies were multiplied, each with different cuts and alterations. The very abundance of the texts testifies to the consistency — as well as the persistency — of his struggle within the dramatic form.
   </p>
   <p>
    How arrive at a text Henry James would have deemed "definitive"? One could always produce a variorum edition, but neither the dramatist, nor the plays, nor the textual problems arising from collation, warranted such a procedure. Some middle course obviously was indicated that would satisfy the demands of scholarship — that is of truth, fidelity to text and to the writer's intentions — while meeting the general purpose which publication of these plays would serve: that of demonstrating their role in Henry James's half-century of creation and of providing a basic text of each play to permit students and public alike to read them and perhaps — if the fancy of some producer might be caught in the process — provide the means for the appearance of at least some of them on the American stage. I therefore directed my editing to this end.
   </p>
   <p>
    It seemed to me that a variorum edition of at least one of the plays was justified, so that the reader might follow the problems James encountered and sought to overcome in the creation of a play. The American was ideally suited to this purpose, since there existed the original typescript of the Southport production with James's alterations in his own hand, and the printed prompt books of the London production, two of them from James's own library, as well as other copies with corrections and stage directions inserted by him or by the actors. It was thus possible to give the mutations of James's first important effort in the theatre, including a variant fourth act.
   </p>
   <p>
    As regards the other plays, a simple principle was applied. Henry James invariably resisted the cutting of his texts. Therefore the plays had to be published in their longest, fullest form, with all the cuts restored; in a few minor instances there were cuts followed by alterations and where these were in James's hand they were accepted as his final reading; where there were simply cuts, these were put back so long as they were consistent with the rest of the text. Where later revisions made re-inclusion of any portion impossible, it was deemed wiser to adhere to the ultimate changes. No generalizations, however, can cover the problems encountered in such a multiplicity of texts and in a number of instances arbitrary editorial discretion had to be exercised; where deemed advisable, the alternate readings have been given.
   </p>
   <p>
    There was one exception from the general rule of the fullest possible text. This was in the case of The High Bid . Having access to the Forbes-Robertsons' typescripts of the play, I decided that it would be of interest to publish the text as actually performed on the stage in 1909, which James had approved, despite a number of alterations and cuts. This play can thus be studied in its three versions: as a one-act play never performed; as the short story Covering End and in the final form it took when it reached the stage.
   </p>
   <p>
    While James went over most of the manuscripts of his plays, making corrections and verbal changes, or inserting new portions, he did not pay close attention in certain instances to spelling or punctuation. There are inconsistencies from play to play and inconsistencies within the plays as well. Where no changes in meaning were involved, punctuation and spelling have been made consistent within each play but have been allowed to stand inconsistent from play to play. Such inconsistencies as Newman's alternately referring to "Valentin" and "Valentine" are retained as in the text as well as James's highly personal and likewise inconsistent method of obtaining emphasis or meaning through capitalization and italicization. In some of the texts the names of the characters were abbreviated before each speech; these have been spelled out as an aid to readability.
   </p>

    Readers seeking bibliographical information concerning the five published plays and the two rare prompt-books of The American and Guy Domville will find these fully described in LeRoy Phillips's Bibliography of the Writings of Henry James (New York, 1930), pp. 26 – 27, 46 – 47 and 115 – 16.

       I should never think of comparing her with Madame! Madame has much more the appearance of one who is born to command. It is for this reason that I approached her with the utmost deliberation. I recognized her three days ago, the evening she arrived at the hotel, and I pointed her out to Mrs. Miller as a Russian lady of great distinction, whose husband I had formerly the honor to serve in a very confidential position. Mrs. Miller has a daughter even more amiable than herself, and this young lady was profoundly impressed with the distinguished appearance of Madame.

       The age doesn't matter — we will call it twenty, if you like — that makes me younger, too. At that time I was under your roof; I was the confidential servant, on a very exceptional footing, of M. de Katkoff. He had a great deal of business — a great deal of diplomatic business; and as he employed me very often to write for him — do you remember my beautiful hand? — I was not so much a servant as a secretary. At any rate, I was in a position to observe that you had a quarrel with your husband.

       The point is this — that I got the advantage of you then, and that I have never lost it! Though you didn't care for your husband, you cared for someone else; and M. de Katkoff — with my assistance, if you will — discovered the object of your preference. Need I remind you of what followed, the day this discovery became known to you? Your surprise was great, because you thought yourself safe; but your anger was even greater. You found me for a moment in your path, and you imagined — for that moment — that I was a Russian serf. The mistake had serious consequences. You called me by the vilest of names — and I have never forgotten it!

They are probably just the opposite, for that is precisely the case with yourself. Most people think you very cold, but I have discovered the truth. You are like one of those tall German stoves, which present to the eye a surface of smooth white porcelain, without the slightest symptom of fuel or of flame.

       You met her at a party, precisely; but unless I wish it, Mrs. Miller doesn't go to a party! I let you know she was to be there, and I advised you how to proceed. For the last three weeks I have done nothing but arrange little accidents, little surprises, little occasions, of which I will do you the justice to say that you have taken excellent advantage. But the time has come when I must remind you that I have not done all this from mere admiration of your distinguished appearance. I wish your success to be
       my
       success!

       You've seen the bareback rider turn a somersault through the paper hoops? It's a very pretty feat, and it brings him great applause; but half the effect depends upon the poor devil — whom no one notices — who is perched upon the edge of the ring. If he didn't hold the hoop with a great deal of skill, the bareback rider would simply come down on his nose. You turn your little somersaults, Signor Cavaliere, and my young lady claps her hands; but all the while
       I
       'm holding the hoop!

       It's a pity you can't walk in Rome without everyone staring so! And now he's not here — he's not where he said he would be. I don't care. He's very nice, but I certainly shan't go and look for him. I'll just wait a little. Perhaps, if I don't walk round, they won't stare at me so much. I didn't say good-by to Mrs. Walker, because she was talking to Mr. Winterbourne, and I shan't go near Mr. Winterbourne again till he comes near me. Half an hour in the room, and never within ten yards of me! He looks so pleasant when he talks — even when he talks to other girls. He's always talking to other girls, and not even to girls — to old women, and gentlemen, and foreigners. I've done something he doesn't like, I'm very sure of that. He doesn't like anything — anything that
       I
       do. It's hard to know what he
       does
       like! He's got such peculiar tastes — from his foreign education; you can't ever tell where you'll find him. Well, I haven't had a foreign education, and I don't see that I'm any the worse for that. If I'd had a foreign education, I might as well give up! I shouldn't be able to breathe, for fear I was breathing wrong. There seem to be so many ways, over here! But I only know one way, and I don't see why I should learn the others when there are people who do like — who do like — what I do. They say they do, at any rate, and they say it so prettily! The English say it very nicely, but the Italians say it best. As for the Americans, they don't say it at all, and Mr. Winterbourne less than any of them! Well, I don't care so much about the Americans: I can make it all right with the Americans when I get home. Mr. Winterbourne isn't an American; I never saw any one like
       him
       over there. If I had, perhaps I shouldn't have come away; for over there
       <pb n="150"/>
       it would all be different. Well, it isn't different here, and I suppose it never will be. Everything is strange over here; and what is strangest of all is one's liking people that are so peculiar.

       Ah, from here the music is very distinct — and the voices of the crowd, and all the sound of the fête. Upstairs, in our rooms, you can hear it just dimly. That's the way it seemed to me — just faint and far — as I lay there with darkened windows. It's hard to be sick when there's so much pleasure going on, especially when you're so fond of pleasure as poor silly me! Perhaps I'm too fond; that's one of the things I thought of as I lay there. I thought of so many — and some of them so sad — as I listened to the far-away Carnival. I think it was this that helped me to get better. I

       was afraid I had been bad, and I wanted to live to be good again. I was afraid I should die, and I didn't want to die. But I'm better now, and I can walk and do everything I want.

That's a sound I always wanted to hear. This is the last night; and when mother and Randolph went out, I couldn't stay there alone. I waited a little; I was afraid of meeting someone on the stairs. But everyone is in the streets, and they have gone to see the illumination. I thought of that balcony: just to look out a little is better than nothing.

       Have you forgotten the day on the Pincian, after your arrival, and what you suddenly offered me — what you promised me — there? You had kept me at arm's length for three years, and suddenly the barrier dropped. The angel of justice has kept the record of my gratitude and eagerness — as well as of my surprise; and if my tenderness and respect were not greater than ever, it is because you had already had the best of them! Have you forgotten our moonlight drive through the streets of Rome, with its rich confusion of ancient memories and new-born hopes? You were perfect that evening, and for many days afterwards. But suddenly you began to change — to be absent, to be silent, to be cold, to go back to your old attitude. To-night it's as if you were trying to make me angry! Do you wish to throw me over, and leave me lying in the dust? Are you only the most audacious of coquettes?

       It's not I who have changed; it's you! Of course I remember our moonlight drive, and how glad you were to take it. You were happy for an hour — you were happy for three days. There were novelty and excitement in finding that, after all, I had a heart in my bosom; and for a moment the discovery amused you. But only for a moment! So long as I refused to listen to you, you
       <pb n="171"/>
       cared for me. From the day I yielded, I became a bore!

She is dying, I say, and between us we are killing her! Dying because she loves you, and because she thinks you despise her! Dying because you have turned away from her, and she has tried to stifle the pang! Dying because I have held you here — under compulsion of a scoundrel — and she thinks she has lost you forever! I read it all in her eyes — the purest I ever saw. I am sick of the ghastly comedy, and I must tell the miserable truth. If you will believe me, it's not too late!
