      To be taken into the biggest firm on Wall Street. I should say it was a great promotion, and Harry — I mean, Mr. Kellogg, deserves it too. Deserves every bit of it, you tell him I said so. Why, he's pulled off more deals for them in the last year.

      I have. Kept books in a fish market for nine. Tried paying laundry bills and clothing myself on three. Did the whole thing; you know, only one schooner of beer a day and rolled my own cigarettes. Didn't have to get to work until five in the morning and I lasted eight weeks at that job, before I was taken sick. Shows what a great constitution I have. I've tried all the jobs that are open to a man with a knowledge of Latin and Greek and higher mathematics. Shipping clerk, time-keeper, cashier, all of 'em; and I decided that I'd rather die than live the way I had to live on such wages. I thought I had a chance when I was taken ill at the fish market — there was nothing doing; I was well again in two weeks. Perhaps a fellow can stand those boarding-houses that's been brought up in them — but when you've been used to the other thing, it's unbearable — filthy rooms — awful grub and the crowd you have to meet.

      Then let me tell you. The boys, who've got stuff in 'em, get out and become the biggest men in our cities. The Yaps stay there and clerk in father's store. But it's not so easy for the
      girls
      to get away. A few of them do by going to boarding schools and colleges and meeting and marrying some chaps from a City, but most of them have to stay at home. Why, by the time kids are old enough to think of getting married there isn't a small country town in America where you won't find four times as many girls as boys, and such boys! There isn't one in ten, that a girl who's got any sense at all could force herself to marry. Do you see? Demand forty
      <pb n="23"/>
      times the supply. Do you know there are twenty times as many good looking old maids in country towns as there are in the cities. It's a fact, because when they were young they couldn't lower themselves enough to accept what was left in the local market. Do you see what I'm getting at?

      Well, you will in a moment. Now take a young chap from the city with a good appearance, educated, more or less of a gentleman, who doesn't talk like a Yap or walk like a Yap or dress like a Yap, or act like a Yap, thrown into such a town. Why I tell you there's nothing to it.

      It's good sense, anyway. Now, here you are, down on your luck, don't know how to earn your living, refusing to accept anything from your friends, ready to lie, steal, or murder to get some money, and on the other hand, here are hundreds of country heiresses with plenty of money for two, who you may easily fall in love with, leading the most unhappy lives. Now why not take one — and her money, make her happy, be happy yourself and be on Easy Street for the rest of your life?

      Church and work are the biggest parts of the game, but you've only got to keep them up until you've landed what you're after. As soon as you get to your town hunt up some old woman who'd like to take a boarder; make arrangements with her and move in. Be sure and find one who talks a lot so she'll tell the neighbors all about you. Don't worry about that, though, they all talk! When you've located, stock up your room with about twenty of the driest looking books in the world, have drawing instruments, pencils, pens, red and black ink and all that sort of thing on the table, and make the room look as if you were the most profound student ever. Be sure and have a well worn Bible too.

      Next make the rounds of the stores and ask for work. Try and get into the dry goods store if you can. The girls all shop there, but anything will do except a grocery or a hardware store or places like that. You mustn't take any job where you'll soil your clothes or get your hands rough.

      They'll send for you after a time. When they see you'll draw trade. And
      every
      Sunday, church! Pick out the one the rich people go to. Go in quietly and do just as they do. Stand up and sit down, look up the hymns and sing. Be careful not to look as if you were trying to show off. Don't sing too loud or anything like that, but do it all modestly, as if you were used to it. Better go to church here two or three times and get the hang of it. Now nearly all the wealthy old ducks in those towns are church deacons and though they might not speak to you for months on the outside, it's their business after church is over to shake hands with you, hope you enjoyed the sermon and ask you to come again, and they'll all take notice of you from that time on.

     SCENE: — SAMUEL GRAHAM'S drug store in Radville, Pa. It is a desolate and dilapidated old store, the soiled and faded paper cracking off the wall in spots. Village street backing . Window up R. in which are several old bottles and odds and ends, sponges, moth-balls, etc. Two gas jets for lighting up the window. Old hat rack to L. of window on the wall. Up R., inside of window, old work bench with various tools and a model of some sort. Underneath the bench is some sort of an arrangement looking like a dentist's laughing gas arrangement with pipes leading to a small tank. A rubber hose leads from this tank to a gas jet just above it . ( This gas jet is practical, being the one BURNHAM lights during the ACT.) Up R. C. is an old bench made out of a couple of saw horses with a model of one of MR. GRAHAM'S inventions. Old chair in front of work bench. An old stove down C. with pipe leading off ( Overhead ) to L. An old chair to L. of it and an old box to R. of it. Up L. is an old prescription counter with several large bottles all of which are empty or nearly so and an old cigar case with the glass broken, several packages and an old candle holder with candle . L. and running obliquely up and down stage is soda counter with a practical tap, with glasses and holders and a few bottles all of which are empty except one which is about half full of vanilla syrup. Behind soda and prescription counters are rows of dirty shelves with numerous bottles of various sizes most of which are empty. On lower shelf of row behind the soda counter is a flask of whiskey and a whiskey glass . Down R. is door leading to the street with the name of S. GRAHAM on the door — half of the letters are missing .. On L. is door leading to office. On this door is some lettering which was once "Office" but now looks like "Of ic."

Folks wonder what you're doing here. I could tell them. You're here to show off your good clothes and your finger-nails and the way you part your hair and all the other things you do that nobody in New York would pay any attention to.

      He said so. But it's your father I want to talk about. Now I'll bet he knows more than any other man in this town and besides that he's a fine, square, good-hearted old gentleman, anyone can see that — only he has one awful fault, he doesn't know how to make money and that's mighty tough on you; but when you roast him for it you only make him feel as miserable as a yellow dog and doesn't help matters a bit. He can't change into a sharp business crook now, he's too old a man. Before long he — he won't be with you at all and when he's gone you'll be sore on yourself — sure — if you keep on throwing it into him as you did just now —

This working and helping Graham is all very noble and fine and I'm glad you've done it, this drug store is a monument to your business ability; but come on down to earth now. This place is paying a little profit, very good, that's all it will ever do. It's all new to you and you're having the time of your life finding out you're good for something. But, from now it will get stale; and before long you'll hate it and next you'll hate the

      Oh no! Why Nat, you began it the first day I saw you in the old store, by the things you said to me. Then I watched you as you made life a heaven for father and me; and I thought, if I were a man I'd try to be as near like you as I could. The time you told me you were going to send me to school, I said to myself, "I'll follow his example just as near as I possibly can — I'll work ever so hard and I'll try to treat people as he treats them, and, oh, Nat, it's worked so wonderfully! It's made all the girls at school like me, and
      now
      , what's ten thousand times best of all, you notice an improvement the moment you see me! And I, I never was so happy in my life.

Suppose you'd come to the end and were about to be turned out of your store when along comes a young fellow and gave you every dollar he had in the world to start you over again and then he worked with all his might — day after day until he'd made everything comfortable and easy for you, suppose he changed your shabby little girl into

      a beautiful young woman and then a patent that you'd have sold for $500, only for him suddenly brought you in a whole lot of money, who would you think it belonged to?
