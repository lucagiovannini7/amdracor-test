   <p>
    THE following Dramatic trifle was not written for publication, but merely to serve the Gentleman on whose night it was performed. — The Author is fully sensible, that the plea of its being a hasty Production is no excuse for obtruding on the Public an incorrect Composition; but, being importuned by his Friends, he has consented to throw this Child of the Day on the protection of the World, encouraged by the flattering reception it received at the Theatre, and the candour once before shewn to its Author.

     <l n="121">
      See me safe landed in the United States;

     <l n="122">
      And now I'm at the best part of my story,
     </l>
     <l n="123">
      For there poor Darby was in all his glory;
     </l>
     <l n="124">
      From north to south, where ever I appear'd,
     </l>
     <l n="125">
      With deeds and words, my spirits oft they cheer'd;

     <l n="130">
      There too I saw some mighty pretty shows;
     </l>
     <l n="131">
      A revolution without blood or blows;
     </l>
     <l n="132">
      For as I understood the cunning elves,
     </l>
     <l n="133">
      The people all revolted from themselves;
     </l>
     <l n="134">
      Then after joining in a kind confession,
     </l>
     <l n="135">
      They all agreed to walk in a procession;

     <l n="136">
      So turners, taylors, tinkers, tavern-keepers,
     </l>
     <l n="137">

     <l n="138">
      All neatly dress'd, and all in order fair,
