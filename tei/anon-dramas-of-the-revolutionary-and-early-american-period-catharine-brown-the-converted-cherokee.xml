     <p>
      Good morning friend Thornton.

      Mr.

     </speaker>
     <p>
      I don't see what you find so very entertaining
      in those religious newspapers. I seldom come in, without
      finding you reading a magazine, or a report of some charitable
      society, or some publication of that kind. It is as
      much as I can do, to read the political news; and learn
      what is going on in the political world.
     </p>

     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.

     <p>
      I confess it is my greatest joy to witness the
      wonderful improvements, which are making in the moral
      state of the world.

     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Well, I have no time for discussing those subjects
      now. What say you to a removal to the south.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.

     <p>
      I am not uneasy with my present situation.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrolmstead">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Well, then you may live amongst these rocks
      and hills. For my part, I am tired of plowing and digging,
      where I cannot find dirt enough to cover a hill of corn,
      without turning my hoe sideways. The winters are milder
      in the south, and the land is more feasible. My farm is advertised
      for sale, and in a few weeks I intend to be in the
      state of Mississippi.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Have you never feared, the health of your family,
      would be less secure, in a southern climate?

     <speaker>
      Mr.

     <p>
      I am not one of that sort of people who are always
      borrowing trouble. Other families live there, and
      why cannot mine?
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Are you not afraid of the Indians, who reside in
      that country? They are sometimes accused of being troublesome.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrolmstead">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
      Fic.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      — Do you think I am afraid of Indians?
      They'll soon have to make their escape, I warrant you, and
      <pb/>
      take up their residence on the other side of the Mississippi.
      There was a whole township of them destroyed last year,
      by a Capt. Wright, I think it was; and others will have to
      share the same fate, if they don't go farther back into the
      woods.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Then the plan is to cut off the savages, and take
      possession of their lands by violence. I had much rather
      hear you say you intend to
      civilize
      the wild licentious savage;
      to tame his ferocious nature, and teach him the principles
      of christianity.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrolmstead">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Teach the birds christianity. It is impracticable.
      What does it signify, to spend time and money for
      nothing?
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Let us not pronounce the civilization of the
      Indians impracticable. Why are not the natives of this
      country, as capable of improvement, as those of Africa and
      the western Islands?
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrolmstead">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Well, what if they are?
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Then we have encouragement to make exertions,
      in their behalf. On one of the Islands in the Pacific
      Ocean, there has been erected in the course of a few years
      eighty-four houses for christian worship, and the Sabbath is
      better observed than it is in most christian nations. In
      South-Africa, there are hundreds now labouring in the
      field, and in the work-shop, who, a few years ago, were
      sunk lower, in vice and ignorance, than the savages on our
      borders.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrolmstead">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Olm.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      Whether they are capable of improvement or
      not, I have no notion of sparing such monsters of cruelty, to
      go forth with tomahawk and scalping knife, against the defenceless
      inhabitants of our new settlements. This would
      be a new sort of benevolence.
     </p>
    </sp>
    <sp who="#mrthornton">
     <speaker>
      Mr.
      Tho.
     </speaker>
     <p>
      I am far enough from wishing to encourage the
      savages, in the horrid work of human butchery. But have
      they not been provoked by the whites? Have not their
      lands been taken from them without their consent, and their
      cattle driven off? No wonder that while smarting under injuries,
      they have sought revenge. What else can you expect
      of a people who have never been taught to forgive injuries?
      I hope if you go to the state of Mississippi, you will
      have occular demonstration of the practicability of civilizing
      <pb/>
      the Savages. For there is in that vicinity, a missionary
      station at a place called Brainard, where the work has
      been most auspiciously commenced.

      How vain that young creature appears.
      If I did not believe there was a Supreme ruler of the universe,
      who has the hearts of all men in his hands, and who
      can turn them as the rivers of waters are turned; I should
      have no hope, that she would ever love any thing but Indian
      finery. But who knows what may take place. If the Almighty
      should see fit to snatch her as a brand, from the
      burning; she may even in the course of a few weeks, become
      so altered, that one would hardly take her to be the
      same person. Thanks be to Jehovah, there is such a consolation,
      as the throne of grace. I shall remember this vain
      creature, and plead most earnestly in her behalf. — —

      My brethren — When I was at the great
      city of Washington, and had a talk with the President our
      father, I saw the great men of the land; I heard their talks:
      They put me in mind of the stately trees, of the forest that
      look so noble, and whose branches extend far and wide, to
      shelter the more humble trees, that grow within their reach.
      I thought, what makes these men so noble? I found it was
      education. I saw their women: They would appear by the
      side of our women, like the rose — the honey-suckle — and
      the ivy — by the side of the cowslip, the daisy, and the snow-drop.
      I thought, what makes these women so conspicuous?
      I found it was education. I thought our sons and daughters
      might be made like them.

      When I have been looking at our young
      men, and seeing them bounding like the Antelope, over
      mountains, and through rivers, in search of prey, an in quest
      of pleasure; I have thought, why cannot they be tamed?
      Although their fathers set them the example, we are tired
      of the chace — we admire cultivated fields, and our land can
      be made equal to the gardens of white men. Our daughters
      are sprightly as the larks — their voices are shrill as the
      Linnet's — clear as the running brook, and soft as the Nightingale's.
      I am for schools.

      They give our men strong water, that makes them foolish —

      thus we went on from city to city, until we arrived at Boston:
      We saw great men, and beautiful women: We looked
      at their cotages: Once in a few miles, they had houses to
      worship in — to worship the great spirit, who is the giver of
      all good. It grieved us to think that beautiful country was
      once ours, and we obliged to wear the name of savage: Let

      I perceive, brethren, you are all anixous to
      have learning and religion introduced in your several nations.
      This belief affords me much satisfaction. We have
      long believed you to be men as well as ourselves; that you
      have minds equally capable of improvement, and souls susceptible
      of endless felicity. We shall rejoice to see your
      hitherto injured race brought forward — shall rejoice to see
      you civilized, and evangelized. There is no enjoyment,
      nor any privilege, which is in our possession, but that we
      wish you an equal share: we are willing to do you all the
      good we can. You have many friends living, at the north,
      who all wish you happiness here, and hereafter. When
      your friends have been informed of the cruelty, deceit,
      and wickedness of the white men that surround your
      border; when we have been told how these abandoned men
      would intoxicate and demoralize your people, and steal
      your cattle; and when your characters have been misrepresented
      by them, to your disadvantage, we have mourned
      and wept in compassion to you. And when, by constant
      and repeated abuse, they make "your poor men wretched,
      and induce your rich men to move away," still farther from
      <pb n="20"/>
      the light of the gospel "our hearts sink within us, and we
      feel constrained to weep — we seek where to weep; we enter
      our closets and weep there." Think not, my brethren,
      that all white men are your enemies. No; many gentlemen
      and ladies, of the first respectability in the United
      States, lay your case deeply to heart. They ask themselves
      where, and what should they have been, had they
      not been instructed and enlightened — they then say, as we
      would wish others to do unto us, let us do even so to them;
      and upon that principle they are making great exertions to
      promote your welfare, and it will be highly gratifying when
      they are informed you have so much anxiety on the subject.

      I have concluded to go, sir. It appears to me to
      be my duty. When I first retired, the tumult of my soul
      was very distressing. To leave this beloved spot, with its
      many blessings, was an idea almost insupportable; and yet
      I feared the providence of God was about to send me far,
      far away. A flow of tears, relieved my bursting heart; at
      the throne of Grace, I became calm and undisturbed. I began
      to consider. I recollected I had given myself to my
      God, and he had engaged to be my portion forever. His
      word has passed, that his children shall have no more trials,
      than they shall be able to endure; and that they shall not
      be tempted, except there be a way for an escape. I recollected,
      that Joseph, was sent by a mysterious providence,
      far away from the house of Israel; and obliged to dwell in
      in a land of idolaters. Yet God was with him, and ever
      preserved him from partaking of their sins. I hope in God.
      I will also put my trust in him, and endeavour to go on my
      way rejoicing.

      Catharine, as painful as
      it is, I must first say the trying word, farewel. May the
      righteous Jehovah, ever be your guide and guard; and if
      we never again meet in this world, may we all spend an eternity
      together, blessed and happy.

      From
      the tender embrace, and the parting kiss, I must tear myself
      away; the indulgence of which, will be two much for my
      already tried feelings. Ye fathers — ye more than mothers
      — my beloved brothers and sisters — farewel.

      "Precious babe in Christ; a few months ago,
      brought out of the dark wilderness; here illuminated by the
      word and Spirit of God; and now to be sent back to the
      dark shades of the forest, without one fellow-traveller, with
      whom she can say, 'Our Father.' Oh ye, who with delight,
      sit under the droppings of the sanctuary, and enjoy
      the communion of saints, remember Catharine in your
      prayers"
