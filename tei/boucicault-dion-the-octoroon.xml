       Bless his dear old handwriting, it's all I ever saw
       of him. For ten years his letters came every quarter-day with
       a remittance, and a word of advice in his formal cavalier style;
       and then a joke in the postscript that upset the dignity of the
       foregoing. Aunt, when he died, two years ago, I read over

       Yes, we do, ma'am; it's in a darned bad condition.
       Ten years ago the Judge took as overseer a bit of Counecticut
       hardware called McClosky. The Judge didn't understand accounts — the
       overseer did. For a year or two all went fine. The
       Judge drew money like Bourbon whiskey from a barrel, and
       never turned off the tap. But out it flew, free for everybody
       or anybody, to beg, borrow, or steal. So it went, till one day
       the Judge found the tap wouldn't run. He looked in to see
       what stopped it, and pulled out a big mortgage. "Sign that,"
       says the overseer; "it's only a formality." "All right," says
       the Judge, and away went a thousand acres; so at the end of
       eight years, Jacob McClosky, Esquire, finds himself proprietor
       of the richest half of Terrebonne —

       Hold on, now! I'm going to straighten this account

      </speaker>
      <p>
       Improvements — anything, from a staylace to a fire-engine.
       Well, he cut that for the photographing line. He
       and his apparatus arrived here, took the Judge's likeness and
       his fancy, who made him overseer right off. Well, sir, what
       does this Scudder do but introduces his inventions and improvements
       on this estate. His new cotton gins broke down,
       the steam sugar-mills burst up, until he finished off with his
       folly what Mr. McClosky with his knavery began.

      ain't necessary for me to dilate, describe, or enumerate; Terrabonne
      is known to you as one of the richest bits of sile in
      Louisiana, and its condition reflects credit on them as had to
      keep it. I'll trouble you for that piece of baccy, Judge — thank
      you — so, gentlemen, as life is short, we'll start right off. The
      first lot on here is the estate in block, with its sugar-houses,
      stock machines, implements, good dwelling-houses and furniture;
      if there is no bid for the estate and stuff we'll sell it in
