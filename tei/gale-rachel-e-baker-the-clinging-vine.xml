     Madam President, we have made a beginning by attacking the farms on the outskirts of the town. We were present at the evening milking of Mr. Wright's cows, and we found a practical demonstration of the cleansing of the pails and cans quite necessary. In fact, we, ourselves, washed them, but I must confess that our efforts were not appreciated. The language used by Mr. Wright would be unfit for me to repeat to this club, which is the acme of culture and refinement.
     <stage>
      ( Applause from the members, which MRS. BEADLE acknowledges .)

     Madam President and members of the Bartonville Woman's Club, upon this table are three articles

     which we believe will prove that Mrs. Redding has violated the laws of this club.

     Exhibit A — an infant's cap. You will note that it is of excellent shape and beautifully made. The stitches are uniform, and show an experienced hand.

     Exhibit B — a man's shirt. Almost a lost art in the family circle. To make a shirt like this would consume many hours, — aye, days. Now, ladies, the woman who made this shirt must have neglected the duties of this club. Instead of marching on the broad highway with her banner unfurled, she has sat within the narrow confines of her own home and plied the needle, not the pen.
     <stage>

     Exhibit C — this loaf of bread. A perfect loaf of bread. It is light bread.

     Very light bread. How much better that the woman who used her muscle for the kneading of that bread should have — metaphorically speaking — used it to break down the barriers that stand between woman and her well deserved rights.

      ( taking up loaf of bread ),
     </stage>
     and I only wish that I could always be sure of as good bread as this. Members of the Bartonville Woman's Club, Miss Peabody has already called your attention to this cap — that it is beautifully made and shows a skilled hand in needle-craft. Does this cap mean only that? Does it not stand for something more than that? Is it not a beautiful illustration of a mother's tender care? The thoughtfulness of a mother's love? This loaf of bread? Does it not show the solicitude of a good housewife for the welfare of her husband and children? This bread is not carelessly put together to ruin their health and digestion. No, not at all, my friends. Time and care have been put into its making. Can a woman battle with the wrongs of a nation on the broad highway and make good bread at the same time? No, my friends, no! This shirt — what more beautiful or ennobling sight than to see a fond husband, aye, and a proud one, too, wearing a shirt that his wife has made for him. No matter if the neck-band is too small, or the buttonholes too large, he suffers in silence, proud in the possession of what my friend on my left has been pleased to call "the clinging vine."

     One moment. Mrs. Smith's child did not say that these articles
     were
     the property of her mother but
     looked
     like it. Mrs. Smith's zeal for the welfare of this club made her resort to drastic measures, I admit, but where would this club be if every member remained at home to sew and bake? What would become of your Municipal League? Your protection of the rights of women? The future prosperity of your country?

     Mrs. Smith has admitted that she has made these articles. That they are
     well
     made proves that it is the natural instinct of a wife and mother to give loving care to her husband and children. To travel on the "broad highway" is but a fleeting fancy, which in time will lose its allurement. Madam President and members of the Bartonville Woman's Club, while you are attending these meetings, while you are investigating the conditions of the outlying districts, when you vote at the polls,
     who
     takes care of your children? Are they sent to school with faces and hands properly washed? their hair brushed and with
     buttons on their shoes?
     I fear not; and what is the result? That some woman, whose name I may not divulge, some
     "clinging vine"
     as my esteemed colleague has been pleased to call it, has felt this condition so keenly, that at her own expense, she is about to erect an edifice for the neglected children of this town where they can be cared for while their mothers are busy with the welfare of the nation. Let women vote, I say! but let it be home and children
     first
     .
