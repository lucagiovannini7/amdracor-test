     ACT I

    <stage>
     SCENE: "The Ladies' Tree" near Domremy.
    </stage>
    <stage>
     Springtime of 1428; a holiday gathering of young folk from the hamlet . The trunk of the great beech tree, rising toward the back of the scene, left centre, spreads its branches ( left ) to a group of white birches, in the half concealment of which stands a stone bench. From beneath the branches of the beech ( on the right ), one looks away to the outskirts of a little French thatched village, more guessed than seen, in the not-far distance. Almost touching the tree-bole ( on the left ) stands a shrine, with a painted image of the Virgin . Near this, leaning against the tree, sits a young man (GERARD), dressed — in part — as a soldier, one arm and his breast being bandaged. He watches the boys and girls dancing a country round, in which the latter carry garlands. On the edge of the dance ( left ) sits a placid group of old women knitting . The Boys and Girls, taking respective parts in voice and pantomime, sing as they dance .
    </stage>
    <stage>
     With a finale of tossed kisses and dropt curtsies, the lasses give their garlands to the lads, who hang them on the trunk of the beech tree, after which all scatter, laughing and talking, into groups — cracking nuts, love-making, playing games. In one group ( right ), playing knuckle-bone on the grass, is JEANNE D'ARC, inconspicuous amongst the others

     SCENE: The Castle of Chinon. March 8, 1429.
    </stage>
    <stage>
     An audience-hall, sparsely furnished with an indigent magnificence . The chief entrance at back is in the centre. On the right of this an ornate clock, with chimes. On the left, high in the wall, a stained-glass window depicts the Emperor Charlemagne, with the shield of France, holding a crown. Against the left wall, a throne-chair with canopy; in the right wall, a fireplace with chimney-seat. At the oblique angle of the right and back walls, a stairway descends from a colonnade, partly visible without . The scene, opening, discovers KING CHARLES seated on an arm of the throne-chair, with one foot on the seat, the other crossed over his knee. Round his neck, behind, is hung a placard, lettered in red and gold: LE ROI DAGOBERT C'EST MOI He is surrounded by LADIES of the Court, who are merrily shouting a song, whilst they watch the royal TAILOR, who bends assiduously over the King's crossed leg, plying his thread and needle. Beside him stands his spool-and-shears basket . Apart from these, at a table near the fire, are seated LA TREMOUILLE and DE CHARTRES. The former is busily engaged in looking over a pile of parchments. From time to time he is approached with great reverence by servants and courtiers .

     D'Alençon, wearing Charles's royal cloak, sits on the throne. All those present range themselves as his subjects, some standing near, others closing about Charles, where he stands ( right centre ). Reënter then, at back, Vendôme, followed by DOCTORS of the Church; these by De Metz and De Poulangy, who stand by the door; last enters Jeanne, dressed as a man. The Doctors, exchanging with Vendôme a hardly detectable look of understanding, approach D'Alençon, make their obeisances, and stand away. Vendôme, motioning then to Jeanne, moves forward to conduct her to D'Alençon as king, but pauses as she does not follow. Standing in the doorway, Jeanne, lifting her face intensely toward the stained-glass window, seems to listen. At the same moment, while the eyes of all are centred upon Jeanne, there emerges from the great fireplace, where logs are burning, and stands upon the hearth with flaming wings, St. Michael, who gazes also at Jeanne. The only sound or other motion in the hall is caused by the Court-fool, who, springing up from the throne-footstool to whisper of the Maid in D'Alençon's ear, sets thereby the bells on his cap to tinkling silverly. Simultaneously, the voice of St. Catherine speaks, as from mid-air

     Glancing slowly through the hall, the eyes of Jeanne meet those of St. Michael, who points with his hand at Charles, then turns and disappears within the smoke and glow of the fireplace. Moving then with decision, Jeanne follows Vendôme, but oblivious of D'Alençon, passes on straight to Charles, before whom she kneels down

     The clock begins to chime. In the same instant, the sunlit form of the Emperor in the stained glass is seen to turn toward the King — where he gazes at him past the face of Jeanne — and to hold out aloft the glowing crown of fleur-de-lis. From the colonnade, the persons of the court look on, whisper together, pointing at the King, where apparently he is kneeling, struck with adoration, at the feet of Jeanne. D'Alençon, standing forward from the rest of the court, is intent upon Jeanne, as, with the inward light of a vision mirrored, her face looks down on the King with a mighty intensity

    <stage>
     SCENE: A Meadow before the Walls of Orleans. May 7, 1429.
    </stage>
    <stage>
     In the near background ( occupying a large part of the scene ) a green knoll overlooks the not distant river Loire flowing toward the right, and a part of the city wall, which sweeps beyond view, left. On this knoll are discovered Franciscan friars grouped about an altar, beside which floats a white painted banner, sprinkled with fleur-de-lis. [Note: 1Kb On one side of this banner (which, authentically, was Jeanne's personal standard) is depicted — on the ground of fleur-de-lis — Christ in Glory, holding the world and giving His benediction to a lily, held by one of two angels, who are kneeling at each side; on the other side the figure of the Virgin and a shield with the arms of France, supported by two angels. The friars also have in their charge two smaller banners, viz.: one a pennon, on which is represented the Annunciation; the other, a banneret, adorned with the Crucifixion. One of these friars , PIGACHON, is dressed half in armour, his cassock — worn over a steel corslet — being tucked up, thus revealing his legs encased in steel. On the left of the scene are women, old men, and priests of Orleans. The foreground and the rest of the adjacent meadow are thronged with French officers and soldiery. In the midst of the latter ( centre ), Jeanne d'Arc — in full armour — is dictating a letter, which PASQUEREL, her confessor, transcribes on a parchment .

     During the last verses Pasquerel, having examined the banner critically, fetches a copper box, opens it, lays out some sewing and painting materials, lowers the banner, and bends over it solicitously. With the last words of the chant, a serene quiet falls upon the knoll, save when, from time to time, contrasting sounds of the distant battle interrupt, or fill the pauses of the conversation between Pasquerel and Pigachon .]

At centre, beneath the trees, stand two benches of wood, one higher than the other. On the right, a stack of arms, and behind that vague outlines of a camp. Throughout the scene's action, from time to time, officers and guards of the French army pass by, or are visible in their battle-gear, as portions of the scene. After the rising of the moon, the walls and towers of the town are dimly visible in the background . Enter, right, La Tremouille and CAUCHON, the latter in the garb of a layman .

     <stage>
      A Street in Rheims. July 17, 1429.
     </stage>
     <stage>
      The street itself is hidden behind an old, half-ruined wall of the city, over the irregular top of which are visible the upper windows, balconies, and gables of the houses opposite, from which the inmates are seen watching the crowds below, invisible to the audience. The foreground of the scene consists partly of the wall itself, partly of an embankment ( with a crooked, elevated foot-path, conducted by stone steps to different heights ), which slopes upward to the wall's edge. On the left, at a breach in the wall, is a wide ruined gate, admitting ingress from the street on to the lower foreground left where the path starts to ascend the slope of the embankment. Seated on the wall, or peering over it ( where they stand on the embankment foreground ), and filling the gateway, are varicoloured groups of persons. Among these ( right ) are Pierre Cauchon and NICOLAS LOISELEUR, in the dress of artisans; near the gateway, amid a group of peasants, Jacques d'Arc, Perrin, Pierre d'Arc, and Mengette. High in a seat of vantage on the wall, a PRIEST is looked up to by the people near by, as a presiding authority . The following dialogue is spoken — with varying intervals of pantomime — during partial lulls in the hubbub of the hidden populace in the street, and the reflex of that among the groups of the foreground . As the curtain rises, there resound from the left a fanfare and a vast, distant shout .

     SCENE: Jeanne's Prison at Rouen. May 30, 1431.
    </stage>
    <stage>
     A dim room, with only one small, barred window ( at back ) very high up. Doors, right ( down stage ) and left ( up stage ). Massive stone pillars sustain the ceiling. Inconspicuous in the obscurity of the right upper corner stands a narrow cage, with irons for the occupant's neck and hands . As the scene opens, a group of persons in black ecclesiastical gowns is seen passing slowly across the prison chamber, from the door of an inner room ( right ) to the outer door ( left ). Among them are Pierre Cauchon and Nicolas Loiseleur. They are followed by John Gris , BROTHER MARTIN LADVENU, and the CAPTAIN OF THE ENGLISH GUARD. In the background loiter THREE SOLDIERS OF THE GUARD, coarse types of men-at-arms .

      But it is time to instruct you more fully, my lords and judges, on the offences, excesses, crimes, and misdemeanours committed by the accused, Jeanne d'Arc, in many and diverse places. In her childhood she was not instructed in the beliefs and principles of our Faith; but by certain old women she was initiated in the science of witchcraft, divination, superstitious

      Obstinate in her presumption, Jeanne hath said, proclaimed, and published that she recognized and discerned the voices of Archangels, Angels, and Saints; and she hath affirmed that she knoweth how to distinguish their voices as of such; she hath not feared to proclaim that St. Michael, Archangel of God, did himself come to her; also that by revelation of Saints the crown of Charles the King was shown to him through her. All these are lies imagined by Jeanne at the instigation of the Devil, or suggested by demons in deceitful apparitions, to make sport of her curiosity — she who would search secrets beyond her capacity and condition.

    FINIS
                    ADDENDA
In Act I, the refrain of the opening song is dialectical. In Act III, the
                        letter dictated by Jeanne to the English is authentic; in the same act, the
                        hymn, Veni, Creator Spiritus , known as the Hymn of
                        Charlemagne, was historically sung by Jeanne and the French before battle.
                        In Act V, the words spoken by the Voice of the Clerk are transcribed
                        directly from the translation of the Seventy Articles, prepared by the
                        Promoter d'Estivet, which formed the Accusation of Jeanne's Trial in
                        Ordinary — published in the Appendix of the volume of Original Documents on
                        Jeanne d' Arc, edited by T. Douglas Murray, New York, McClure, Phillips, &amp;.mp;
                        Co., 1902.
The author's sincere acknowledgments are due to Mrs. Patrick Campbell for her
                        friendly interest in having specifically directed his attention to the above
                        illuminating book, which has constituted the chief informing source, and a
                        large inspiration, to his work.
The music of the play — incidental, as well as lyrical — has been composed by
                        Mr. F. S. Converse, and may be had in published form.
The cover design and the scene illustrations of the present volume were drawn
                        by Mr. Barry Faulkner.
The acting rights of the play, in America and England, are owned by Mr. E. H.
                        Sothern and Miss Julia Marlowe.
