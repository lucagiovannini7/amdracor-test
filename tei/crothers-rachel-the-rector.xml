    RACHEL CROTHERS
   </head>
   <p>
    Rachel Crothers was born at Bloomington, Illinois, in 1878. We are told that when still in her teens she tried her hand at playwriting. She shortly joined an amateur dramatic club in her home city, and later taught elocution. She then joined a theatrical company and toured for some years. Her earliest plays, among which is "The Rector," were produced when she was an advanved student at a school of acting. Her first play was produced in New York City in 1903. "The Three of Us," one of her first significant plays, was produced in 1906. This was followed by "A Man's World," "He and She," "The Herfords" and "Young Wisdom." Among her best recent plays are "Old Lady 31," "Nice People," "Mary the Third" and "Expressing Willie."
   </p>
   <p>
    Miss Crothers excels in the art of characterization. Like most women damatists she is at her best among the types she knows and understands. Her satirical works are skilful exhibitions of American life and character. "The Rector" is the best of Miss Crothers' short plays and has for several years been a favorite among amateurs.
   </p>
   <p>
    Following is a list of Miss Crothers' published plays:
   </p>
   <p>
    "He and She"; "A Man's World"; "The Three of Us"; "Mary the Third"; "Old Lady 31"; "A Little Journey"; "39 East"; "Nice People"; "The Rector"; "Expressing Willie."

     SCENE: Study in a Country parsonage . TIME: The present .

  <body>
   <stage>
    A winter morning . The study in a country parsonage. There is a bay window in flat R., showing the yard with fence and trees covered with snow . The door at L., in flat, opens into a narrow hall — off of which the street door opens . A door up left opens into the dining room, and one at R., into the Rector's sleeping room . A large shabby desk is placed sidewise in the window with a rickety revolving chair before it . The sofa and chairs, awkward and uncomfortable, are covered with horse-hair. There is an oval shaped marble topped table at L. C., with three chairs about it . The table and several chairs are heaped with newspapers and books. The desk is strewn with writing materials, letters, books, etc. There is a half dead fire in the small fireplace down L. — and the general effect is shabby, neglected and desolate . It is snowing without and as the characters enter the snow is seen on their clothing . JANIE is the Rector's housemaid. Her little sunny face smiles upon him and the friends of whom she approves, but frowns with open displeasure upon those she suspects of designs upon the Rector and his household . She wears a neat red calico dress, an apron much patched, and her hair, brushed as tightly back as possible, is braided and twisted into a large knot from the middle of which dangles a shoestring. On her forehead one small curl paper shows a small desire for beauty and improvement . As the curtain rises she comes in from the hall, sniffing and shivering with the cold, with a bunch of letters in her hands which she examines curiously — then turning suddenly she rushes back into the hall, calling loudly from the street door .

Her walk, her manner, her speech, are uncouth but lovable — utterly without training, and yet with an air of self-confidence that makes her always mistress of the situation .)

     Oh dear, yes! Dear, dear, yes! I've made some notes on the question, and I've brought some samples. I went in town yesterday, and I just made it a point to look at carpets too, and get an idea of color and design and durability; so that I could report and help things along. Here they are.
     <stage>
      ( Taking squares of carpet out of the black silk bag which she carries .)
     </stage>
     Now, you know — but of course you
     don't
     know, how could you, being a man, and alone at that — but it
     is
     a fact that
     red
     , in the long run, is more lasting and satisfactory on the whole than any other thing in the carpet line. Now, a good housekeeper knows the important thing — there it is again, a good housekeeper! What do
     you
     know about good housekeepers? And by the way, my dear boy, that reminds me. You know I look upon you very much as a mother would; for I know how lonely and helpless you are, and I'm going to speak from my heart. I know it isn't always possible for you to know just what is best for you, and how you stand in the community. Now I — I speak for your own good, you know, — I have heard of late many complaints, because you are so young
     and
     unmarried.

     I think a strong good man can make a woman what he wants her to be, if she loves him; and why shouldn't Victoria — love you? I don't know — it all seemed a little strange just now. I hadn't thought, of course. But don't be afraid, if you are
     sure
     that that is what your life and heart need. Don't fear that she can't realize your ideal of what your wife ought to be — to help — and
     you
     know. Love always touches the highest key in a woman's nature, and
     through
     it, and

     Oh, don't! I — I love you. It's absurd I know — and you're laughing at me. I'm poor — a country minister, and you — you're a butterfly — utterly free, apart from duties and troubles of any kind. That's all. I'll go — and you'll forget. But I'm glad I said it. I love you. That's all.
