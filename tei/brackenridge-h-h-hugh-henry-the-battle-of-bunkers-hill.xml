    TO  RICHARD STOCKTON, Esquire ;
                             MEMBER  OF THE HONOURABLE,  THE  CONTINENTAL
                            CONGRESS,  FOR THE STATE  OF  NEW-JERSEY.

   <p>
    SIR,
   </p>
   <p>
    I take the Freedom to Inscribe with YOUR Name, the following short Performance in Honour of some brave Men , who have fallen in the Cause of Liberty.
   </p>
   <p>
    It was at first drawn up for an Exercise in Oratory, to a number of young Gentlemen in a southern Academy, but being now Published, may serve the same Purpose, in other American Seminaries.
   </p>
   <p>
    The many Civilities, received from YOUR Family, at an earlier Period of my Life, while a Student at New-Jersey College, demand the warmest Gratitude; and I do continually, with the most sincere Pleasure, recollect and acknowledge them.
   </p>
   <p>
    It is my fervent wish, that the Ruler of the Universe may Crown with Success, the Cause of Freedom , and speedily relieve our bleeding Country in whose Service YOU have distinguishedly exerted YOUR eminent Abilities, by assisting HER Deliberations in the grand Council of the Empire.
   </p>

    PROLOGUE  TO THE  BATTLE  OF 
                            BUNKERS-HILL. 
                            By a Lieutenant Colonel in the
                            Continental Army. [By unknown]
   </head>
   <p rend="l">
    This mighty Æra big with dread alarms,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Aloud calls each American to arms.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Let ev'ry Breast with martial ardor glow,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Nor dread to meet the proud usurping foe.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    What tho' our bodies feel an earthly chain,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Still the free soul, unblemish'd and serene
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Enjoys a mental Liberty , — — a charm,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Beyond the power of fate itself to harm.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Should vict'ry crown us in the doubtful strife —
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Eternal honours mark the hero's life.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Should Wounds and slaughter be our hapless doom —
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Unfading laurels deck the Martyr's Tomb:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    A sure reward awaits his soul on high,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    On earth his memory shall never die.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    For when we read the fatal story o'er,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    One tear shall drop for him who is — no more.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who nobly struggled to support our laws,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    And bravely fell in freedom's sacred cause
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Let virtue fire as to the martial deed;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    We fight to conquer and we dare to bleed:
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Witness ye fathers! whose protracted time,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Fruitful of story, chronicles the clime.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    These howling deserts, hospitably tame,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Erst snatch'd you martyrs, from the hungry flame;
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    'Twas Heav'n's own cause, beneath whose shelt'ring power,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Ye grew the wonder of this present hour — —
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    The task — be ours with unremitted toil,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    To guard the rights of this dear-purchas'd soil,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    From Royal plund'rers, greedy of our spoil,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who come resolv'd to murder and enslave,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    To shackle Freemen and to rob the brave.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    The loud mouth'd cannon threaten from afar,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Be this our comfort in the storm of war — —
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who fights, to take our liberty away,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Dead-hearted fights, and falls an easy prey.
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Then, on my brethren to the embattl'd plain,
   </p>
   <p rend="l">
    Who shrinks with fear, anticipates a chain.

    EPILOGUE
Written by a Gentleman of the Army.
Supposed to be spoken, immediately after the Battle; By
                            Lieutenant Colonel
                            Webb , Aid de camp to General
                            Putnam.

The Field is their's, but dearly was it bought,
 Thus long defended and severely fought.
Now pale-fac'd death fits brooding o'er the strand,
And views the carnage of his ruthless hand.
But why my heart this deep unbidden sigh,
Why steals the tear, soft trickling from the eye?
Is Freedom master'd by our late defeat
Or Honour wounded by a brave retreat?
'Tis nature dictates; and in pride's despite,
I mourn my brethren slaughter'd in the fight.
'Th' insulting foe, now revels o'er the ground,
Yet flush'd with victory, they feel the wound.
Embru'd in gore, they bleed from ev'ry part,
And deep wounds rankle at Britannia's heart.
O fatal conquest! Speak thou crimson'd plain,
Now press'd beneath the weight of hundreds slain!
There heaps of British youth promiscuous lie,
Here, murder'd Freemen catch the wand'ring eye.
Observe you stripling bath'd in purple gore,
He bleeds for Freedom on his native shore.
His livid eyes in drear convulsions roll,
While from his wounds escapes the flutt'ring soul,
Breathless and naked on th' ensanguin'd plain,
Midst friend and brothers, sons and fathers slain.
No pitying hand his languid eyes to close,
He breathes his last amidst insulting foes;
His body plunder'd, massacred, abus'd;
By Christians — Christian fun'ral rites refus'd — 
Thrown as a carrion in the public way,
To Dogs , to Britons , and to Birds a prey.
Enwrapt in sulph'rous flame and clouds of smoke,
Brave Gard'ner sinks beneath the deadly stroke,
And Warren bleeds to grace the bloody strife
And for his injur'd country gives his life.
Yet while his mighty soul ascends the skies,
On earth his blood for ten-fold vengeance cries.
Great spirit rest — by Heaven it is decreed,
Thy murd'ring tyrants by the sword shall bleed.
E'en racks and gibbets would but consecrate,
And death repeated be too kind a fate.
The sword is drawn, in peace no more to rest,
Till justice bathes it in some tyrants breast.
Honour my weapon with the glorious task,
And let me stab, 'tis all the the boon I ask.
Kind pow'rs, beneath your all-protecting shield,
I now unsheath my sword, and take the field,
Sure of success, with this sweet comfort giv'n,
Who fights for Freedom , — fights the cause of Heav'n.

ODE on the Battle of BUNKERS-HILL. Sung and Acted by a
                                            
                                         in a Military Habit, with his

In the same Measure with a Sea Piece, Entitled
                                        the Tempest.

 — Cease rude BOREAS, blust'ring railer — 
I.



You bold warriors, who resemble, Flames, upon the distant hill,At whose view, the heroes tremble, Fighting with unequal skill.Loud-sounding drums now with hoarse murmurs, Rouse the spirit up to war,Fear not, fear not, tho' their numbers, Much to ours, superior are.Hear brave Warren bold commanding, "Gallant souls and vet'rans brave,See the enemy just landing, From the navy-cover'd wave.Close the wings — advance the center —  Engineers point well your guns — Clap the matches, let the rent air, Bellow to Britannia's sons."Now think you see, three thousand moving, Up the brow of Bunkers-Hill ,Many a gallant vet'ran, shoving, Cowards on against their will.The curling volumes all behind them, Dusky clouds of smoke arise,Our cannon-balls, brave boys shall find them, At each shot a heroe dies.Once more Warren midst this
                                            terror, "Charge brave soldiers charge again,Many an expert vet'ran warrior Of the enemy is slain.Level well your charged pieces, In direction to the town;They shake, they shake, their light'ning ceases, That shot brought fix standards down."Maids in virgin beauty blooming, On Britannia's sea-girt isle,Say no more your swains are coming, Or with songs the day beguile.For sleeping sound in death's embraces, On their clay-cold beds they lie,Death, grim death, alas defaces, Youth and pleasure which must die."March the right wing Gard'ner
                                            yonder, Take th' assailing foe in flank,The heroe's spirit lives in thunder, Close there Serjeants, close that rank,The conflict now doth loudly call or Highest proof of martial skill,Heroes shall sing of them, who fall on, The slipp'ry brow of Bunkers-Hill
                                            ."Unkindest fortune, still thou changest, As the wind upon the wave,The good and bad alike thou rangest, Undistinguish'd in the grave.Shall kingly tyrants see thee smiling, Whilst the brave and just must die,Them of sweet hope and life beguiling In the arms of victory."Behave this day my lads with spirit, Wrap the hill top as in flame;Oh if we fall, let each one merit, Immortality in fame.From this high ground like Vesuv'us Pour the floods of fire along;Let not, let not, numbers move us, We are yet five hundred strong."Many a widow sore bewailing Tender husbands, shall remain,With tears and sorrows, unavailing, From this hour to mourn them slain.The rude scene striking all by-standers, Bids the little band retire,Who can live like salamanders, In such floods of liquid fire?"Ah! Our troops are sorely pressed,  Howe ascends the smoky hill,Wheel inward, let these ranks be faced, We have yet some blood to spill.Our right wing push'd, our left surrounded, Weight of numbers five to one,
Warren dead, and Gard'ner wounded, Ammunition is quite gone".See the steely points, bright gleaming, In the sun's fierce dazling ray,Groans arising, life-blood streaming, Purple o'er the face of day.The field is cover'd with the dying, Free-men mixt with tyrants lie,The living with each other vying, Raise the shout of battle high.Now brave Putnam , aged soldier, "Come my vet'rans, we must yield;More equal match'd, we'll yet charge bolder, For the present quit the field.The God of battles shall revisit, On their heads each soul that dies,Take courage boys, we yet shan't miss it, From a thousand victories."
A SPEECH 
                            By General WASHINGTON,
On his entering the Town of Boston ,
                            at the Head of the American Army , after the British Troops were by his skilful Approaches obliged
                            to abandon it.

Auspicious day, of happiness unmix'd!
 When this fair City, without blood-shed won,
Receives to her sweet bosom, once again,
Her free-born sons, of perseverance try'd,
And noble fortitude, in deeds of arms.
Now let the father, meet his infant son,
His virgin daughter, and long faithful spouse,
And kiss away all tears, but those of joy.
Now, let the ardent lover clasp his fair,
New flush the red rose in her damask cheek,
Light up the glad beam in her rolling eye,
And bid all pain and sorrowing be gone.
Oh happy day — Shine on thou blissful sun,
And not one vapour, blemish thy career,
Till from thy mid-day champaign, wheeling down,
Thou in the western ocean go to rest.
O happy town — Now let thy buildings smile,
Thy streets, run down, with silver floods of joy,
And from thy temples, loudly, hymn and song,
Sweep, the high arches, of resounding Heaven.
Yes fellow soldiers, let us bend to him
Who gave us strength, and confidence of soul,
To meet the Battle and fierce iron war,
Urg'd on severe by the tyrannic foe,
With deadly thunder, and mischievous arms.
To him who with his tempest, bulg'd the deep,
And their full hundred war-ships, on the bay,
Chain'd, with his strong wind, to the North-east shore.
The hand of Heaven, is visible in this,
And we Oh God, pour forth our souls in praise.
O fellow soldiers let our off' rings rise,
Not in rich hecatombs, of bulls and goats,
But in true piety, and light of love,
And warm devotion, in the inward part.
Let your festivity, be mix'd with thought,
And sober judgment, on this grand event.
March on, and take true pleasure to your arms,
You all are bridegrooms, to fair joy to day.

ARMYA  MILLITARY SONG,  BY THE 
                                        
                                         :
On General Washington's
                                        victorious entry into the Town of Boston.



Sons of valour, taste the glories; Of Celestial Liberty ,Sing a Triumph o'er the Tories, Let the pulse of joy beat high.Heaven this day hath foil'd the many, Fallacies of George their King,Let the echo reach Britan'y, Bid her mountain summits ring.See yon Navy swell the bosom, Of the late enraged sea,Where e're they go we shall oppose them; Sons of valour must be free.Should they touch at fair Rhode-Island
 There to combat with the brave,Driven, from east hill, and highland, They shall pursugh the purple wave.Should they thence, to fair Virgin'y
 Bend a squadron to Dunmore ,Still with fear and ignominy, They shall quit, the hostile shore.To Carolina or to Georg'y , Should they next advance their fame,This land of heroes shall disgorge the, Sons of tyranny and shame.Let them rove to climes far distant, Situate under Artic skies,Call on Hessian troops assistant, And the Savages to rise.Boast of wild brigades from Russia, To fix down the galling chain,Canada and Nova Scotia, Shall discharge these Hords again.In New-York State, rejoin'd by Clinton , Should their standards mock the air,Many a surgeon, shall put lint on, Wounds of death, received there.War fierce war shall break their forces, Nerves of tory men shall fail,Seeing Howe with alter'd courses, Bending to the western gale.Thus, from every bay of ocean, Flying back, with sails unfurl'd,Tost with ever-troubl'd motion, They shall quit, this smiling world.Like Satan banished, from Heaven , Never see, the smiling shore,From this land so happy, driven, Never Stain, its bosom more.
                        
                    
                    THE END.
