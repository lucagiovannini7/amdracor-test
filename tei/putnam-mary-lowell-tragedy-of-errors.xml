       Now that he's dead and gone, I think she had. —
      </l>

       Our master's youngest sister, when she married,
      </l>
      <l n="120">
       Took that boy off with her to her plantation:
      </l>
      <l n="121">
       'T was great promotion for him, that it was!
      </l>
      <l n="122">
       He was to be her coachman. He was dressed

       Like any gentleman, and hardly had
      </l>
      <l n="124">
       A thing to do but go out on the carriage.
      </l>
      <l n="125">
       He was n't old enough, they thought, to drive:

       He was but sixteen, though he looked like

      </l>
      <l n="127">
       Well, whether 't was the Devil tempted him,

      <l n="128">
       Or whether 't was the pride his mother gave him, —
      </l>
      <l n="129">
       At any rate, one morning he was missing.
      </l>
      <l n="130">
       At first no one believed 't was so; but soon

       The truth came out. "To horse and after him!"

      <l n="132">
       So went the word. It was not long in doing. —

       Our master was there then, and I was with him. —
      </l>

      <l n="136">

      </l>
      <l n="137">

      Ezekiel advances slowly, frequently stopped by persons who go out from the different groups to speak to him. He is a tall, well-proportioned man, very black, with finely formed head and regular features. He is distinctly seen, for he towers above the others. A little behind him comes Turpin , a man of middle height, slender, of pale complexion, with black beard and curling black hair. His features are delicately cut, but wear an expression of defiance, displaced now by one of reckless jollity, now of cynical disdain, as he exchanges jests and sarcasms with the gay groups among whom he passes.

       For the last time. The old man had that day

      <l n="509">
       Received no alms. He stretched his feeble body,

       When the night fell, upon the cold, hard stone,
      </l>
      <l n="511">
       But his soul raised itself to God in prayer.
      </l>
      <l n="512">
       Grateful he prayed, with heart o'erflowed with
                                        love.
      </l>
      <l n="513">
       He thanked his Maker for the inward light
      </l>
      <l n="514">
       That overpowered the outward gloom, — for
                                        strength
      </l>
      <l n="515">
       Divinely sent, which made the body's weakness
      </l>
      <l n="516">
       Appear no evil more. As thus he prayed,
      </l>
      <l n="517">
       And more and more his soul strove up to God,
      </l>
      <l n="518">
       Sudden it seemed to disengage itself:
      </l>
      <l n="519">
       It rose, it soared, it found itself in heaven! —
      </l>
      <l n="520">
       This was the face that Dives knew again:
      </l>
      <l n="521">
       "Lazarus himself!" he said; and then he wished
      </l>
      <l n="522">
       That the last time he passed the beggar by
      </l>
      <l n="523">
       He 'd happened to have given him a cent.
      </l>
      <l n="524">
       Too late for that! But still, when he considered
      </l>
      <l n="525">
       What honor it would be for Lazarus
      </l>
      <l n="526">
       To do a favor to a man like him,
      </l>
      <l n="527">
       He thought he 'd risk the making a request.
      </l>
      <l n="528">
       So, for the first time, he sent up a prayer:
      </l>
      <l n="529">
       He begged that Lazarus might come to him
      </l>
      <l n="530">
       And bring him down only a drop of water
      </l>
      <l n="531">
       To cool his tongue. Oh, but his thirst was
                                        fearful!
      </l>
      <l n="532">
       Soon as the wish was thought, 't was heard in
                                        heaven,
      </l>
      <l n="533">
       And back the answer came as swift again:
      </l>
      <l n="534">
       "Thou hadst thy good things in the earthly life,

       And Lazarus his evil. It is finished.

      A large room, with windows opening on a long portico, whose columns are wreathed with vines. Stanley and Hermann are seated near one of the windows, engaged in conversation. Emma reclines on a sofa. Near her stands a table, on which is a large vase of white flowers. The room is profusely decorated with flowers. A little slave-girl stands near Emma, employed in fanning her. The child lets the fan sink, and turns towards the window.

      <stage>
       Clasping her hands passionately, and rising.
      </stage>
      <stage>
       Sinking down again.

      <stage>
       After a pause, tenderly.

       She goes to the table, leans over the vase, and touches the flowers.
      </stage>
      <stage>
       With joy.
      </stage>
      <stage>
       She goes to the window.

      <stage>
       She goes out.

       They leave me here to meet the storm alone!
      </l>
      <l n="559">
       What's Bella? What can she do for me? Oh,
      </l>
      <l n="560">
       I shall die here of fear and loneliness! —
      </l>
      <l n="561">
       My Helen comes! My lovely, graceful Helen!
      </l>
      <l n="562">
       And with her — Hecate comes! Ah, there it is!
      </l>
      <l n="563">
       Hecate comes back to freeze, to petrify me!
      </l>
      <l n="564">
       And everybody thinks she's so devoted!
      </l>
      <l n="565">
       They wonder I could give her up to Helen. —
      </l>
      <l n="566">
       How I remember when she first came near me!
      </l>
      <l n="567">
       I felt her fix her basilisk eyes on me,
      </l>
      <l n="568">
       And a cold shiver ran through all my veins.
      </l>
      <l n="569">
       Was it a warning sent to me, perhaps? —
      </l>
      <l n="570">
       Every one envied me my handsome slave.
      </l>
      <l n="571">
       I had not enough courage to refuse her.
      </l>
      <l n="572">
       Why did I not? O Hecate! my life's vampire! —
      </l>
      <l n="573">
       Yet I have nothing to reproach her with, —
      </l>
      <l n="574">
       Or only with too constant a devotion. —
      </l>
      <l n="575">
       How high she held herself, the silent creature!
      </l>
      <l n="576">
       Dumb out of pride, — not out of ignorance,
      </l>
      <l n="577">
       As we supposed at first. — When first I heard
      </l>
      <l n="578">
       The accents of her voice, how strange a thrill
      </l>
      <l n="579">
       Shot through my heart! It was again a warning. —
      </l>
      <l n="580">
       It was for Helen that she broke her silence.
      </l>
      <l n="581">
       Yes, yes, she came between me and my child!
      </l>
      <l n="582">
       And this is why I cannot love my daughter
      </l>
      <l n="583">
       As other mothers do. O Helen, Helen,
      </l>
      <l n="584">
       Could my heart once gush out for you in
                                        fondness!
      </l>
      <l n="585">
       Could I but once enjoy a mother's rapture,
      </l>
      <l n="586">
       In full, full, overflowing, deluging measure,
      </l>
      <l n="587">
       And yield my soul in that o'erwhelming bliss!
      </l>
      <l n="588">
       That moment, that death moment, should repay me
      </l>
      <l n="589">
       My torpid life! —
      </l>
      <l n="590">
       No, it is not for me! —
      </l>
      <l n="591">
       How did I long for you, my pretty darling,
      </l>
      <l n="592">
       Before you came! how did I press my lips
      </l>
      <l n="593">
       On that dreamed cheek! how did I twine my
                                        fingers
      </l>
      <l n="594">
       In airy ringlets of imagined gold!
      </l>
      <l n="595">
       O precious one! O little unseen daughter!
      </l>
      <l n="596">
       Dearer even now than is my living child!
      </l>
      <l n="597">
       Yes, when you came, you should restore me all:
      </l>
      <l n="598">
       My Agatha should live again in you;
      </l>
      <l n="599">
       The love my parent-sister poured on me
      </l>
      <l n="600">
       I should return to you in seven-fold measure,
      </l>
      <l n="601">
       And that which my fond heart had felt for her
      </l>
      <l n="602">
       Should throb for me in my sweet daughter's
                                        bosom!
      </l>
      <l n="603">
       Oh, all those tedious years of lonely life
      </l>
      <l n="604">
       Passed with that hard, dry, selfish hypocrite,
      </l>
      <l n="605">
       That governess of mine, and my stern father,
      </l>
      <l n="606">
       How did they disappear and melt in nothing!
      </l>
      <l n="607">
       My coming life appeared to link itself
      </l>
      <l n="608">
       To the far past: these made my whole existence.
      </l>
      <l n="609">
       I almost thought I always had been happy.
      </l>
      <l n="610">
       And when the time came that I was to press you
      </l>
      <l n="611">
       Real and substantial in these waiting arms,
      </l>
      <l n="612">
       Oh, it was Hecate held you up to me!
      </l>
      <l n="613">
       Oh, it was Hecate laid you on my bosom! —
      </l>
      <l n="614">
       How came she there? I did not send for her, —
      </l>
      <l n="615">
       I did not want her. — When I felt the touch
      </l>
      <l n="616">
       Of my own child, it was not what I looked for.
      </l>
      <l n="617">
       My heart stood still, instead of bounding up.
      </l>
      <l n="618">
       Something came in between my babe and me.
      </l>
      <l n="619">
       It was her love. That creature dared to love it!
      </l>
      <l n="620">
       She dared to vie in tenderness with me
      </l>
      <l n="621">
       For my own infant! —
      </l>
      <l n="622">
       I am very weak!
      </l>
      <l n="623">
       I know I'm weak. I'm sure that Stanley thinks
                                        so.
      </l>
      <l n="624">
       'T is so, or I had never let her nurse it.
      </l>
      <l n="625">
       Yes, I am weak, — or only strong to suffer! —
      </l>
      <l n="626">
       What was she to my child, that she should love
                                        it?
      </l>
      <l n="627">
       My happiness was poisoned at its source.
      </l>
      <l n="628">
       In vain my baby bloomed in health and beauty;
      </l>
      <l n="629">
       I could not love with fulness of enjoyment.
      </l>
      <l n="630">
       I saw her little arms thrown fondly round
      </l>
      <l n="631">
       That neck, her head reposing on that bosom!
      </l>
      <l n="632">
       Yet could I sooner have forgiven the love
      </l>
      <l n="633">
       The unreasoning child bestowed upon its nurse
      </l>
      <l n="634">
       Than that strange chill that sat on my own
                                        heart.
      </l>
      <l n="635">
       Did I not love her? Did I not admire her?
      </l>
      <l n="636">
       Had I not pride in her? Yes, all of this!
      </l>
      <l n="637">
       Yet, even as she sat upon my lap,
      </l>
      <l n="638">
       And I was fondling her with every mark
      </l>
      <l n="639">
       Of fullest, deepest love, when I looked round
      </l>
      <l n="640">
       And saw that stranger woman standing near,
      </l>
      <l n="641">
       Ready to take my not unwilling darling,
      </l>
      <l n="642">
       I felt the impotence of my dull heart.
      </l>
      <l n="643">
       Her silent look said more than my caressings.
      </l>
      <l n="644">
       I sank back baffled, weary, inly owning
      </l>
      <l n="645">
       The nurse's tenderness was more than mine.
      </l>
      <l n="646">
       It was a spell that woman cast on me.
      </l>
      <l n="647">
       These Africans are skilled in dreadful arts,
      </l>
      <l n="648">
       Which they transmit, the mothers to their
                                        daughters,
      </l>
      <l n="649">
       And they to theirs. Hecate might well be one
      </l>
      <l n="650">
       To share this fearful legacy. Her look —
      </l>
      <l n="651">
       And, above all, when it is fixed on me —
      </l>
      <l n="652">
       Has something in it of undying pain,
      </l>
      <l n="653">
       Mixed with exulting triumph, that might suit
      </l>
      <l n="654">
       A priestess of those temples that they tell of
      </l>
      <l n="655">
       Where men pay worship to the fallen spirit.
      </l>
      <l n="656">
       It holds me still, this chilling, cramping
                                        spell!
      </l>
      <l n="657">
       I wait my child, not as the mother waits
      </l>
      <l n="658">
       Whose fond protecting love requires an object
      </l>
      <l n="659">
       To foster and support. — I foster Helen!
      </l>
      <l n="660">
       I guide and counsel, I admonish her,
      </l>
      <l n="661">
       As mothers do! Poor, little, feeble woman,
      </l>
      <l n="662">
       I, guardian of that vigorous, noble creature!
      </l>
      <l n="663">
       She is less mine than ever! For my infant
      </l>
      <l n="664">
       I could in part fulfil the mother's office,
      </l>
      <l n="665">
       Could minister at times to little wants,
      </l>
      <l n="666">
       Could aid to conquer petty obstacles,
      </l>
      <l n="667">
       Could soothe in childish troubles, fancied dangers,
                                        —
      </l>
      <l n="668">
       Could at least feel myself the wiser, stronger.
      </l>
      <l n="669">
       But, ah, how soon she passed beyond my reach!
      </l>
      <l n="670">
       I am the earthbound bird that sees the swanlet
      </l>
      <l n="671">
       Its wings have brooded soaring high in space. —
      </l>
      <l n="672">
       It is my birthday! No one thinks of it,
      </l>
      <l n="673">
       Except that poor half-crazy girl, Theresa!
      </l>
      <l n="674">
       These were her gift, these flowers I thought so
                                        kind.
      </l>
      <l n="675">
       Why did she bring them? Not to do me pleasure. —
      </l>
      <l n="676">
       They are all white, as for a bride — or corpse.
      </l>
      <l n="677">
       In her mind had they some significance? —
      </l>
      <l n="678">
       Perhaps they are a sign of penitence.
      </l>
      <l n="679">
       Her heart may have been touched by Helen's coming. —
      </l>
      <l n="680">
       Perhaps she thought of Helen's little boy.
      </l>
      <l n="681">
       Yes, white means innocence. — Perhaps she meant
      </l>
      <l n="682">
       A type of the pure joy of this reunion.
      </l>
      <l n="683">
       I'll take it so.
      </l>
      <l n="684">
       And yet I do not feel it.
      </l>
      <l n="685">
       Since I have known these flowers were brought by
                                        her,
      </l>
      <l n="686">
       It seems to me their leaves are touched with
                                        blight.
      </l>
      <l n="687">
       They look at me as in reproach or warning.
      </l>
      <l n="688">
       What would they say to me? What pain awaits me? —
      </l>
      <l n="689">
       No, nothing new! The present is sufficient!
      </l>
      <l n="690">
       These pallid flowers, plucked by unloving hands,
      </l>
      <l n="691">
       Alone remind of my neglected birthday. —
      </l>
      <l n="692">
       And yet perhaps Helen did not forget it. —
      </l>
      <l n="693">
       She thought of me, when she arranged this
                                        journey!
      </l>
      <l n="694">
       My Helen thought of me! I hear her say, —
      </l>
      <l n="695">
       "That day shall give my mother back her
                                        daughter."
      </l>
      <l n="696">
       And shall I be the last to welcome her?
      </l>
      <l n="697">
       Why do I stay? The clouds are passing off.
      </l>
      <l n="698">
       The storm but threatened. Some few drops of
                                        rain,
      </l>
      <l n="699">
       And it is over. All my idle fears
      </l>
      <l n="700">
       Pass off as easily! My heart feels light,
      </l>
      <l n="701">
       As suits the day that gives me back my child.
      </l>
      <l n="702">
       My child!
       Sweet words! And this
                                        day brings her back!
      </l>
      <l n="703">
       The flowers repeat it, the birds warble it!
      </l>
      <l n="704">
       All Nature seems to sing in happy chorus:
      </l>
      <l n="705">
       "This day shall give the mother back her child!"

     <stage>
      Stanley and Hermann are walking together in a wide avenue. On one side are trees; on the other an open lawn. They stop at a spot where a large tree has been left standing in the middle of the avenue, which widens out on either side of it. The slaves in holiday attire are ranged along the avenue, or form groups on the lawn, or are looking out from behind the trees.

       A cheerful scene, and full of poetry,
      </l>
      <l n="2">
       To me, a European! These dark faces,
      </l>
      <l n="3">
       These vivid hues, this profuse gesture, — all
      </l>
      <l n="4">
       That speaks the sun-born and the youthful race
      </l>
      <l n="5">
       Has a keen charm in it to one like me,
      </l>
      <l n="6">
       Who live in thought, in whom emotion, impulse,
      </l>
      <l n="7">
       So long held down, almost forget their rights.
      </l>
      <l n="8">
       When first I landed on your shores, I found
      </l>
      <l n="9">
       Not what I had imagined. Everywhere
      </l>
      <l n="10">
       I saw another Europe: busier,

      <l n="11">
       More energetic, and more self-reliant,
      </l>
      <l n="12">
       But the same world, engrossed by the same cares,
      </l>
      <l n="13">
       Pursuing the same ends, with more success,
      </l>
      <l n="14">
       Because with greater freedom, and, alas

      <l n="949">
       The dealer bought her in the far Southwest,

       Came out the history I have given you.

       How much of it is true, and how much fancy,

       Or others' story mingled with her own,
      </l>
      <l n="958">
       It is not easy to decide. At first

       I listened to these tales as to the rest,

      <l n="962">
       What minute details, what consistency
      </l>
      <l n="963">
       The story was repeated, I began

       Yes, — my Aunt Sophia.
      </l>
      <l n="1317">
       I made a visit to her once, and then
      </l>
      <l n="1318">
       I learned what a love-match is. My poor aunt!
      </l>
      <l n="1319">
       They say that she was lovely in her youth,
      </l>
      <l n="1320">
       And never was attachment so romantic
      </l>
      <l n="1321">
       As that between her and her husband, — lover,
      </l>
      <l n="1322">
       I mean, before he had become her husband.
      </l>
      <l n="1323">
       When I first saw her, she was thin and pale,
      </l>
      <l n="1324">
       With anxious eyes shaded by heavy lids:
      </l>
      <l n="1325">
       He was still handsome rather, though too stout.
      </l>
      <l n="1326">
       Could I describe to you that woman's life!
      </l>
      <l n="1327">
       She rose at six o'clock, — it was in winter:
      </l>
      <l n="1328">
       I don't know what time she got up in summer, —
      </l>
      <l n="1329">
       At dawn, no doubt. No sooner up than busy.
      </l>
      <l n="1330">
       First, all the pretty things about the parlor
      </l>
      <l n="1331">
       Were to be dusted by her careful hand:
      </l>
      <l n="1332">
       Servants were not abundant, — and besides,
      </l>
      <l n="1333">
       A breakage was a serious affair.
      </l>
      <l n="1334">
       Then to the work-basket before 't was light.
      </l>
      <l n="1335">
       Shirts were to mend, — when not to make, — and
                                        stockings.
      </l>
      <l n="1336">
       One thing got through, there stood another
                                        ready.
      </l>
      <l n="1337">
       I said one day, — "And when shall you be done?" —
      </l>
      <l n="1338">
       "Done?" — and she turned on me a wondering look, —
      </l>
      <l n="1339">
       "Done what? this apron?" — "Done with all your
                                        work." —
      </l>
      <l n="1340">
       "Never," she said, — and that so placidly!
      </l>
      <l n="1341">
       Then she must hear the younger children's
                                        lessons,
      </l>
      <l n="1342">
       Before they went to school, to have them
                                        perfect.
      </l>
      <l n="1343">
       She'd heard the Latin Grammar through so often,
      </l>
      <l n="1344">
       Beginning with the oldest boys, and coming
      </l>
      <l n="1345">
       Down to the youngest, — just in training then, —
      </l>
      <l n="1346">
       That she could listen to the recitation
      </l>
      <l n="1347">
       And never leave her mending: coarse print, fine
                                        print,
      </l>
      <l n="1348">

       But no, she never got beyond the grammar.

      <l n="1352">
       When they were old enough to do without her,
      </l>
      <l n="1353">
       They went their way, and she began again
      </l>
      <l n="1354">
       The same old story with the younger ones. —
      </l>
      <l n="1355">
       Well, then came breakfast. Just before it came,
      </l>
      <l n="1356">
       The children were admonished to be quiet,
      </l>
      <l n="1357">
       Because papa was coming. Papa came, —
      </l>
      <l n="1358">
       Despatched his breakfast, — read his newspaper, —
      </l>
      <l n="1359">
       Departed for his office. After breakfast,
      </l>
      <l n="1360">
       She washed the breakfast-things and set them up, —
      </l>
      <l n="1361">
       And then to work again. I tried to read
      </l>
      <l n="1362">
       Aloud to her, thinking it quite humane:
      </l>
      <l n="1363">
       But her poor head was so intent on planning
      </l>
      <l n="1364">
       How to make Charley's jackets do for Tommy,
      </l>
      <l n="1365">
       Or how to cut two mantles for the girls
      </l>
      <l n="1366">
       Out of her last-year's cloak, or perhaps only
      </l>
      <l n="1367">
       How to have what remained from yesterday
      </l>
      <l n="1368">
       Made serviceable for another dinner,
      </l>
      <l n="1369">
       That, when I've read some most pathetic
                                        passage,
      </l>
      <l n="1370">
       And my eyes looked for sympathy in hers,
      </l>
      <l n="1371">
       I found that cold, vague, introverted look
      </l>
      <l n="1372">
       Which says the mind, at work within itself,
      </l>
      <l n="1373">
       Is not at home to foreign visitors.
      </l>
      <l n="1374">
       At times, indeed, in some auspicious moment,
      </l>
      <l n="1375">
       I caught her ear, and, through her ear, her
                                        heart.
      </l>
      <l n="1376">
       Once taken captive, it made no resistance,
      </l>
      <l n="1377">
       But suffered me to lead it where I would.
      </l>
      <l n="1378">
       Then fell the hateful work; the needle stopped;

       The humid eye, melting by turns and kindling,

      <l n="1383">
