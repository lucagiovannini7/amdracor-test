     SYNOPSIS
    </head>
    <p>
     The scene of the play is laid in the living-room of Peter Grimm's home at Grimm Manor, a small town in New York State, founded by early settlers from Holland .
    </p>
    <p>
     The first act takes place at eleven o'clock in the morning, on a fine spring day .
    </p>
    <p>
     The second act passes ten days later, towards the close of a rainy afternoon .
    </p>
    <p>
     The third act takes place at twenty minutes to twelve on the same night .
    </p>
    <p>
     NOTE. Mr. Belasco does not intend to advance any theory as to the probability of the return of the main character of this play. For the many, it may be said that he could exist only in the minds of the characters grouped about him — in their subconscious memories. For the few, his presence will embody the theory of the survival of persistent personal energy. This character has, so far as possible, been treated to accord with either thought. The initial idea of the play was first suggested as a dramatic possibility by Mr. Cecil de Mille, to whom Mr. Belasco acknowledges his indebtedness. A conversation with Professor James, of Harvard, and the works of Professor Hyslop, of the American branch of the London Society of Psychical Research, have also aided Mr. Belasco.

     ACT I
    </head>
    <stage>
     The scene shows a comfortable living-room in an old house. The furniture was brought to America by Peter Grimm's ancestors. The Grimms were, for the most part, frugal people, but two or three fine paintings have been inherited by Peter . A small, old-fashioned piano stands near the open window, a few comfortable chairs, a desk with a hanging lamp above it, and an armchair in front of it, a quaint old fireplace, a Dutch wall clock with weights, a sofa, a hat-rack, and mahogany flower-pot holders, are set about the room; but the most treasured possession is a large family Bible lying on a table. A door leads to a small office occupied by Peter's secretary . Stairs lead to the sleeping-rooms above. Through the window, hothouses, beds of tulips, and other flowers, shrubs and trees are seen. "Peter Grimm's Botanic Gardens" supply seeds, plants, shrubbery and trees to the wholesale, as well as retail trade, and the view suggests the importance of the industry. An old Dutch windmill, erected by a Colonial ancestor, gives a quaint touch to the picture. Although Peter Grimm is a very wealthy man, he lives as simply as his ancestors . As the curtain is raised, the room is empty; but Catherine is heard singing in the dining-room. James Hartman, Peter's secretary, opens his door to listen, a small bundle of letters in his hand. He is a well set up young man, rather blunt in his manner, and a trifle careless in his dress. After a pause, he goes back into the office, leaving the door ajar. Presently Catherine enters. In spite of her youth and girlish appearance, she is a good, thrifty housekeeper. She wears a simple summer gown, and carries a bunch of gay tulips and an old silver pitcher, from which she presently pours water into the Harlequin Delft vase on Peter Grimm's desk. She peeps into the office, retreating, with a smile on her lips, as James appears .

      It's true. When the train reached the Junction, and a boy presented the passengers with the usual flower and the "compliments of Peter Grimm" — it took me back to the time when that was my job; and when I saw the old sign, "Grimm's Botanic Gardens and Nurseries" — I wanted to jump off the train and run through the grounds. It seemed as though every tulip called "hello" to me.

      Orchids are pretty; but they're doing wonderful things with potatoes these days. I'd rather improve the breed of a squash than to have an orchid named after me. Wonderful discovery of Luther Burbank's — creating an edible cactus. Sometimes I feel bitter thinking what I might have done with vegetables, when I was wasting time studying Greek.

He is a graduate of Amsterdam College, Holland, and, in appearance and manner, suggests the foreign student. He has managed to pull through college creditably, making a specialty of botany. Peter has given him the usual trip through Europe, and Frederik has come to his rich uncle to settle down and learn his business. He has been an inmate of the household for a few months. He poses as a most industrious young man, but is, at heart, a shirker .)

      As an antidote. I was growing to be a fussy bachelor, with queer notions. You are young, but see that you don't need the Doctor, James. Do you know how I was cured? I'll tell you. One day, when I had business in the city, the Doctor went with me, and before I knew what he was at — he had marched me into a home for babies. ... Katie was nearest the door — the first one. Pinned over her crib was her name: "Catherine Staats, aged three months." She held out her little arms ... so friendless — so pitiful — so alone — and I was done for. We brought her back home, the Doctor, a nurse and I. The first time I carried her up those stairs — all my fine bachelor's ideas went out of my head. I knew then that my theories were all humbug. I had missed the child in the house who was to teach me everything. I had missed many children in my house. From that day, I watched over her life.

      You can't call Sir Charles Crookes, the inventor of Crookes Tubes, — a waster? Nor Sir Oliver Lodge, the great biologist; nor Curie, the discoverer of radium; nor Doctor Lombroso, the founder of Science of Criminology; nor Doctors Maxwell, de Vesmé, Richet, Professor James, of Harvard, and our own Professor Hyslop. Instead of laughing at ghosts, the scientific men of to-day are trying to lay hold of them. The frauds and cheats are being crowded from the field. Science is only just peeping through the half-opened door which was shut until a few years ago.

      When we hypnotize subjects, Peter, our thoughts take possession of them. As we enter their bodies, we take the place of a something that leaves them — a shadow-self. This self can be sent out of the room — even to a long distance. This self leaves us entirely after death on the first, second or third day, or so I believe. This is the force which you would employ to come back to earth — the astral envelope.

      It stood a few feet away from the sleeper, and was located by striking at the air and watching for the corresponding portion of the sleeper's body to recoil. By pricking a certain part of this shadow-self with a pin, the cheek of the patient could be made to bleed. The camera was focussed on this part of the shadow-self for fifteen minutes.

      Under these conditions, it is quite impossible to hypnotize a room full of people. Perhaps you think the camera was hypnotized?

Catherine starts as though suddenly brought to herself, hastily goes into the next room, taking the Doctor's book with her. Marta has hurried towards the front door, when the Rev. Mr. Batholommey and Colonel Lawton appear in the hall as though they had entered quickly, to escape the storm. Marta, greeting them, passes off to tell Frederik of their presence. The Rev. Mr. Batholommey wears a long, black cloth, rain-proof coat. Colonel Lawton wears a rubber poncho. Colonel Lawton is a tall man with a thin brown beard and moustache, about forty-eight. He is dressed in a Prince Albert coat, unpressed trousers, and a negligée shirt. He wears spectacles and has a way of throwing back his head and peering at people before answering them. The Rev. Mr. Batholommey sets his umbrella in the hall and the Colonel hangs his broad-brimmed hat on the handle — as though to let it drip .)

      James, Uncle died smiling at me — thinking of me ... and just before he went, he gave me his mother's wedding ring and asked me to marry Frederik. I shall never forget how happy he was when I promised. That was all he wanted. His last smile was for me ... and there he sat — still smiling after he was gone ... the smile of a man leaving the world perfectly satisfied — at peace. It's like a hand on my heart — hurting it — when I question anything he wanted. I couldn't meet him in the hereafter if I didn't do everything he wished; I couldn't say my prayers at night; I couldn't speak his name in them. ... He trusted me; depended upon me; did everything for me; so I must do this for him. ... I wanted you to know this, James, because ...

Peter, who has watched her with appealing eyes, like a dog craving attention, glances from her to the desk and from the desk back to Marta — trying to tempt her to look at the torn letter. Frederik, deep in thought, does not notice her. Peter points to the desk as though to say, "Look!" After a pause, she picks up the picture and the letter — holding them in one hand to clear a spot for the tray which she is about to set on the desk .)

      you're going into the circus without paying for a ticket. You're laying down the burden before you climb the hill. And in your case, William, you are fortunate indeed; for there are some little soldiers in this world already handicapped when they begin the battle of life. ... Their parents haven't fitted them for the struggle. ... Like little moon moths, — they look in at the windows; they beat at the panes; they see the lights of happy firesides — the lights of home; but they never get in. ... You are one of these wanderers, William. ... And so, it is well for you that before your playing time is over — before your man's work begins, — you're going to know the great secret. Happy boy! No coarsening of your child's heart, until you stand before the world like Frederik; no sweat and toil such as dear old James is facing; no dimming of the eye and trembling of the hand such as the poor old Doctor shall know in time to come; no hot tears to blister your eyes, ... tears such as Katie is shedding now; but, in all your youth, your faith — your innocence, — you'll fall asleep and oh! the awakening, William! ...

     The third act takes place at twenty minutes to twelve on the same night . The fire is out. The table on which Peter took his coffee in the first act is now being used by the Doctor for William's medicines, two bottles, two glasses, two teaspoons, a clinical thermometer, &amp;.mp;c. William, who has been questioned by the Doctor, is now asleep upstairs. Peter's hat hangs on the peg in the shadow. Although the hour is late, no one has thought of going to bed. Frederik is waiting at the hotel for the lawyer whom Hicks was to send to arrange for the sale of Peter Grimm's nurseries, but he has not arrived. The Doctor, full of his theories, is seated before the fire, writing the account of Peter Grimm's return, for the American Branch of the "London Society for Psychical Research." It is now a fine, clear night. The clouds are almost silvery and a hint of the moon is showing .

      the breaking off of the engagement is rather sudden, isn't it? We've been talking it over in the front parlour, Mr. Batholommey and I. James has finished his work and has just joined us. I suggest sending out a card — a neat card — saying that, owing to the bereavement in the family, the wedding has been indefinitely postponed. Of course, it isn't exactly true.

      But that child knew it all along. He's eight years old and he was with her until five — and five's the age of memory. Every incident of his mother's life has lingered in his little mind. Supposing you do find her and learn that it's all true: what do you prove? Simply that
      William remembered
      , and that's all there is to it.

      Well, Batholommey, religion has frequently led to the stake, and I never heard of the Spanish Inquisition being called
      healthy
      for anybody taking part in it. Still, religion flourishes. But your old-fashioned, unscientific, gilt, ginger-bread heaven blew up ten years ago — went out. My heaven's just coming in. It's new. Dr. Funk and a lot of the clergymen are in already. You'd better get used to it, Batholommey, and get in line and into the procession.

      saw you. I heard ... I know. ... Here on some sunny, blossoming day when, as a wife, you look out upon my gardens — every flower and tree and shrub shall bloom enchanted to your eyes. ... All that happens — happens again. And if, at first, a little knock of poverty taps at the door, and James finds the road hard and steep — what is money? — a thing, — a good thing to have, — but still a thing ... and happiness will come without it. And when, as a mother, you shall see my plantings with new eyes, my Catherine, — when you explain each leaf and bud to your little people — you will remember the time when
      we
      walked together through the leafy lanes and I taught you — even as you teach them — you little thing! ... So, I shall linger in your heart. And some day, should your children wander far away and my gardens blossom for a stranger who may take my name from off the gates, — what
      is
      my name? Already it grows faint to my ears.

I shall adore your children and be their grandfather just as though I were here; I shall find it hard not to laugh at them when they are bad, and I shall worship them when they are good — and I don't want them too good. ... Frederik was good. ... I shall be everywhere about you ... in the stockings at Christmas, in a big, busy, teeming world of shadows just outside your threshold, or whispering in the still noises of the night. ... And oh! as the years pass,
      <stage>
       ( standing over her chair )

      you cannot imagine what pride I shall take in your comfortable middle life — the very
      best
      age, I think — when you two shall look out on your possessions arm in arm — and take your well-earned comfort and ease. How I shall love to see you look fondly at each other as you say: "Be happy, Jim — you've worked hard for this;" or James says: "Take your comfort, little mother, let them all wait upon
      you
      —
      you
      waited upon
      them
      . Lean back in your carriage — you've

      </stage>
      after all the luxuries and vanities and possessions cease to be so important — people return to very simple things, dear. The evening of life comes bearing its own lamp. Then, perhaps, as a little old grandmother, a little old child whose bed-time is drawing near, I shall see you happy to sit out in the sunlight of another day; asking nothing more of life than the few hours to be spent with those you love, ... telling your grandchildren, at your knees, how much brighter the flowers blossomed when
      you
      were young. Ha! Ha! Ha! All that happens, happens again. ... And when, one glad day, glorified, radiant, young once more, the mother and I shall take you in our arms, — oh! what a reunion!
