     The pleasance in front of the manor-house of Belcaro. It is laid out upon a hillside and affords a view, over some miles of undulating olive groves, of the towers of a medieval Tuscan town and of the mountains beyond and round about it. Immediately adjoining this boxed and laureled pleasure-ground is the doorway of a Romanesque chapel. A bell is ringing. — Present: the Nurse and the Wayfarer .

     I have no choice. — The loss of the first child could bring me no single jot of blame; the loss of the second, so soon after the disappearance of the other, might well have been my ruin. The boy — Belcaro's heir though he be — was no charge of mine; the girl was, and in the strictest sense. That the boy should have been carried off by bandits and that he should have disappeared so suddenly and so completely from among them upon the very day that the ransom was ready to be paid — all this grieved me, for he was a beautiful child and the sole heir of our house. But
     my
     skirts were clear —
     my
     hands were clean. Yet, when —

     I
     was
     to blame. Yet if ever there were excuse ...! This house was attacked at night. We fled — the chances of war. The babe and I were separated from its parents. I plunged frantically into the wood, with that week-old child; all was dark, save for our
     <pb n="163"/>
     burning roofs. I hid the child and sought long for food and shelter. These I found at length — but the child, never. I groped my way back toward her — I searched vainly for the spot. I saw her no more; I did not see her parents for a year. Then the wars were over; our household was once more gathered together. I returned, too. And I brought a child with me.
