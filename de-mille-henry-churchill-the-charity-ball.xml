Putnam said to me — her pew is next to ours, you know — that if I held any shares in the Consolidated Gas Tank Co. to get rid of them at once. I had a thousand! I don't know what in the world John preached about this morning. I had tanks on the brain. Just imagine my anxiety. Being Christmas day, of course, my broker would not be downtown! I sent messengers flying in every direction. And where do you think we found him? In a Turkish bath spending his Christmas. But by twelve o'clock tomorrow morning someone else will be asphyxiated with my gas.

      It can't be done, Mr. Cruger; it can't be done, sir! Until I came into the street, you feared no man. All feared you. Now you, with the rest, fear me! One firm after another has gone to pieces under my touch. You are the only man that blocks my way. And do you think I'll stop? I have no religion, no God, but one ambition — to be master of the street!

Ah, you may be grown men to others, but you are still my boys. Now, which of you shall I punish for keeping the other up so late? It's Dick's fault, I'm sure.

      True. It was only David who was deceived. And, like him, I have been blind. My love for Phyllis was like David's love for Dora. With that love I still had the friendship and sympathy of one who was to me as a sister. When Phyllis passed out of my life, I still had that friendship and sympathy and I could endure.
