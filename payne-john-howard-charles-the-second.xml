       What, is my loyalty to be made my reproach?
       Must I not stand by my monarch in all his moods? —
       Would you have me weep when my sovereign laughs?
       Would you have me whine when my sovereign calls
       for a jolly song? No, no, my lady, that might have
       done in the days of the Roundheads; but times are
       <pb n="4"/>
       altered. We have a merry monarch to reign over us —
       A merry monarch, makes a merry court — so God save
       the jovial king, and send him boon companions!

       Ah me! I fear, like many other of your

       What proof? Am I not ready to give the
       greatest proof that man can offer — to lay down this
       sweet bachelor life, and commit matrimony for your
       sake?

       Well, this last, I must say, coming from a
       Rochester, is a most convincing proof. I have heard
       you

       me.
       <stage>

       I will
       propose a bargain. If, by your ascendancy over the
       king, you can disgust him with these nocturnal rambles,

       A pretty task I have undertaken,
       truly! I — Rochester — become reformer! I who am
       <pb n="5"/>
       considered by all the pious saints about Court, as the
       ringleader of all mischief. And, then, the convert I
       have to work upon? Charles, who glories in all kinds
       of rambling frolics! — True, he has had none but pleasant
       adventures as yet. If I should trick him into
       some ridiculous dilemma? — My whole life has been
       a tissue of follies, and I am called a man of wit. I am
       now to attempt a rational act, and I shall be called a
       madman! — Well, be it so — matrimony will be sure
       to bring me to my senses.

       An honest attachment! A young half-fledged
       page about court, who has hardly tried his wings
       in the sunshine of beauty, to talk of an honest attachment.

       Yes; but I told thee to skim over the surface
       of beauty, just dipping your wings, like a swallow,
       not plumping in like a goose — I told you to hover
       from flower to flower like a butterfly, not to bury
       yourself in one like a bee. An honest attachment!
       What a plebeian phrase! — There's a wife and seven

       Ay, but worth a dozen of me — a steady
       man, an able officer, an ornament of the regular navy.
       I was always a wild dog, and never took to learning —
       ran away from school — shipped myself on board a
       privateer. In time I became captain, and returned
       from my last cruise just in time to receive poor Philip's
       last breath — his sand was almost run out. 'Brother,'
       said he, 'I feel that my cruising is over; but
       there's my little girl. Take care of her for my sake,
       and never bother the Rochesters again.' — 'Brother,'
       said I, 'it's a bargain; tip us your fist on it, and die
       in peace, like a good christian.' He grasped my
       hand, and gave it a gentle squeeze. I would have
       shook his, but it grew cold, and poor Philip was no
       more!

       This should be Captain Copp. In
