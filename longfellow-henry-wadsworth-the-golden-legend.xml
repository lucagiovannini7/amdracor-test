      <l n="57">
       He heard the convent bell

      <l n="58">
       Suddenly in the silence ringing
      </l>
      <l n="59">
       For the service of noonday.
      </l>
      <l n="60">

      <l n="62">
       In the convent there was a change!

      <l n="63">
       He looked for each well-known face,

      <l n="65">
       New figures sat in the oaken stalls,

      <l n="66">
       New voices chaunted in the choir;

      <l n="67">
       Yet the place was the same place,
      </l>
      <l n="68">
       The same dusky walls
      </l>
      <l n="69">
       Of cold, gray stone,
      </l>
      <l n="70">
       The same cloisters and belfry and spire.
      </l>
      <l n="71">
       A stranger and alone
      </l>
      <l n="72">
       Among that brotherhood
      </l>
      <l n="73">
       The Monk Felix stood.
      </l>
      <l n="74">
       "Forty years," said a Friar,
      </l>
      <l n="75">
       "Have I been Prior

      <l n="76">
       Of this convent in the wood,

      <l n="78">
       Never have I beheld thy face!
      </l>
      <l n="79">
       The heart of the Monk Felix fell:
      </l>
      <l n="80">
       And he answered, with submissive tone,

      <l n="81">
       "This morning, after the hour of Prime,

      <l n="82">
       I left my cell,

      <l n="83">
       And wandered forth alone,
      </l>
      <l n="84">
       Listening all the time
      </l>
      <l n="85">
       To the melodious singing
      </l>
      <l n="86">
       Of a beautiful white bird,
      </l>
      <l n="87">
       Until I heard
      </l>
      <l n="88">
       The bells of the convent ringing
      </l>
      <l n="89">
       Noon from their noisy towers.
      </l>
      <l n="90">
       It was as if I dreamed;
      </l>
      <l n="91">
       For what to me had seemed
      </l>
      <l n="92">
       Moments only, had been hours!"
      </l>
      <l n="93">
       "Years!" said a voice close by.
      </l>
      <l n="94">
       It was an aged monk who spoke,
      </l>
      <l n="95">
       From a bench of oak
      </l>
      <l n="96">
       Fastened against the wall; —
      </l>
      <l n="97">
       He was the oldest monk of all.
      </l>
      <l n="98">
       For a whole century
      </l>
      <l n="99">
       Had he been there,
      </l>
      <l n="100">
       Serving God in prayer,
      </l>
      <l n="101">
       The meekest and humblest of his creatures.
      </l>
      <l n="102">
       He remembered well the features
      </l>
      <l n="103">
       Of Felix, and he said,
      </l>
      <l n="104">
       Speaking distinct and slow:
      </l>
      <l n="105">
       "One hundred years ago,
      </l>
      <l n="106">
       When I was a novice in this place,
      </l>
      <l n="107">
       There was here a monk, full of God's grace,
      </l>
      <l n="108">
       Who bore the name
      </l>
      <l n="109">
       Of Felix, and this man must be the same."
      </l>
      <l n="110">
       And straightway
      </l>
      <l n="111">
       They brought forth to the light of day
      </l>
      <l n="112">
       A volume old and brown,
      </l>
      <l n="113">

      <l n="118">
       And there they found,
      </l>
      <l n="119">
       Just as the old monk said,

       The ceaseless sound of human woe;

      <l n="646">
       Here, while her bosom aches and throbs
      </l>
      <l n="647">
       With deep and agonizing sobs,

      <l n="649">
       The luckless daughter of perdition

       The time, the place, the lover's name!

      <l n="652">
       Here the grim murderer, with a groan,

      <l n="653">
       From his bruised conscience rolls the stone,

      <l n="654">
       Thinking that thus he can atone

      <l n="655">
       For ravages of sword and flame!

      <l n="656">
       Indeed, I marvel, and marvel greatly,

      <l n="657">
       How a priest can sit here so sedately,
      </l>
      <l n="658">
       Reading, the whole year out and in,

      <l n="659">
       Naught but the catalogue of sin,

      <l n="660">
       And still keep any faith whatever

       As if he were an archangel, at least.

      <l n="141">
       Was taken and crucified by the Jews,

      <l n="142">
       In that ancient town of Bacharach;

      <l n="143">
       Perdition upon those infidel Jews,

       The rascal who drank wine out of a boot.

       Shall win thy hand, O Irmingard!
      </l>
      <l n="765">
       For which Prince Henry of Hoheneck
      </l>
      <l n="766">
       By messenger and letter sues."
      </l>
      <l n="767">
       Gently, but firmly, I replied:
      </l>
      <l n="768">
       "Henry of Hoheneck I discard!
      </l>
      <l n="769">
       Never the hand of Irmingard
      </l>
      <l n="770">
       Shall lie in his as the hand of a bride!"
      </l>
      <l n="771">
       This said I, Walter, for thy sake;
      </l>
      <l n="772">
       This said I, for I could not choose.
      </l>
      <l n="773">
       After a pause, my father spake
      </l>
      <l n="774">
       In that cold and deliberate tone
      </l>
      <l n="775">
       Which turns the hearer into stone,
      </l>
      <l n="776">
       And seems itself the act to be
      </l>
      <l n="777">
       That follows with such dread certainty;
      </l>
      <l n="778">
       "This, or the cloister and the veil!"
      </l>
      <l n="779">
       No other words than these he said,
      </l>
      <l n="780">
       But they were like a funeral wail;
      </l>
      <l n="781">
       My life was ended, my heart was dead.
      </l>
      <l n="782">
       That night from the castle-gate went down,
      </l>
      <l n="783">
       With silent, slow, and stealthy pace,
      </l>
      <l n="784">
       Two shadows, mounted on shadowy steeds,
      </l>
      <l n="785">
       Taking the narrow path that leads
      </l>
      <l n="786">
       Into the forest dense and brown.
      </l>
      <l n="787">
       In the leafy darkness of the place,
      </l>
      <l n="788">
       One could not distinguish form nor face,
      </l>
      <l n="789">
       Only a bulk without a shape,
      </l>
      <l n="790">
       A darker shadow in the shade;
      </l>
      <l n="791">
       One scarce could say it moved or stayed.
      </l>
      <l n="792">
       Thus it was we made our escape!
      </l>
      <l n="793">
       A foaming brook, with many a bound,
      </l>
      <l n="794">
       Followed us like a playful hound;
      </l>
      <l n="795">
       Then leaped before us, and in the hollow
      </l>
      <l n="796">
       Paused, and waited for us to follow,
      </l>
      <l n="797">
       And seemed impatient, and afraid
      </l>
      <l n="798">
       That our tardy flight should be betrayed
      </l>
      <l n="799">
       By the sound our horses' hoof-beats made.
      </l>
      <l n="800">
       And when we reached the plain below,
      </l>
      <l n="801">
       We paused a moment and drew rein
      </l>
      <l n="802">
       To look back at the castle again;
      </l>
      <l n="803">
       And we saw the windows all aglow
      </l>
      <l n="804">
       With lights, that were passing to and fro;
      </l>
      <l n="805">
       Our hearts with terror ceased to beat;
      </l>
      <l n="806">
       The brook crept silent to our feet;
      </l>
      <l n="807">
       We knew what most we feared to know.
      </l>
      <l n="808">
       Then suddenly horns began to blow;
      </l>
      <l n="809">
       And we heard a shout, and a heavy tramp,
      </l>
      <l n="810">
       And our horses snorted in the damp
      </l>
      <l n="811">
       Night-air of the meadows green and wide,
      </l>
      <l n="812">
       And in a moment, side by side,
      </l>
      <l n="813">
       So close, they must have seemed but one,
      </l>
      <l n="814">
       The shadows across the moonlight run,
      </l>
      <l n="815">
       And another came, and swept behind,
      </l>
      <l n="816">
       Like the shadow of clouds before the wind!
      </l>
      <l n="817">
       How I remember that breathless flight
      </l>
      <l n="818">
       Across the moors, in the summer night!
      </l>
      <l n="819">
       How under our feet the long, white road
      </l>
      <l n="820">
       Backward like a river flowed,
      </l>
      <l n="821">
       Sweeping with it fences and hedges,
      </l>
      <l n="822">
       Whilst farther away, and overhead,
      </l>
      <l n="823">
       Paler than I, with fear and dread,
      </l>
      <l n="824">
       The moon fled with us, as we fled
      </l>
      <l n="825">
       Along the forest's jagged edges!
      </l>
      <l n="826">
       All this I can remember well;
      </l>
      <l n="827">
       But of what afterwards befell
      </l>
      <l n="828">
       I nothing farther can recall
      </l>
      <l n="829">
       Than a blind, desperate, headlong fall;
      </l>
      <l n="830">
       The rest is a blank and darkness all.
      </l>
      <l n="831">
       When I awoke out of this swoon,
      </l>
      <l n="832">
       The sun was shining, not the moon,
      </l>
      <l n="833">
       Making a cross upon the wall
      </l>
      <l n="834">
       With the bars of my windows narrow and tall;
      </l>
      <l n="835">
       And I prayed to it, as I had been wont to pray,
      </l>
      <l n="836">
       From early childhood, day by day,
      </l>
      <l n="837">
       Each morning, as in bed I lay!
      </l>
      <l n="838">
       I was lying again in my own room!
      </l>
      <l n="839">
       And I thanked God, in my fever and pain,
      </l>
      <l n="840">
       That those shadows on the midnight plain
      </l>
      <l n="841">
       Were gone, and could not come again!
      </l>
      <l n="842">
       I struggled no longer with my doom!
      </l>
      <l n="843">
       This happened many years ago.
      </l>
      <l n="844">
       I left my father's home to come
      </l>
      <l n="845">
       Like Catherine to her martyrdom,
      </l>
      <l n="846">
       For blindly I esteemed it so.
      </l>
      <l n="847">
       And when I heard the convent door
      </l>
      <l n="848">
       Behind me close, to ope no more,
      </l>
      <l n="849">
       I felt it smite me like a blow.
      </l>
      <l n="850">
       Through all my limbs a shudder ran,
      </l>
      <l n="851">
       And on my bruised spirit fell
      </l>
      <l n="852">
       The dampness of my narrow cell
      </l>
      <l n="853">
       As night-air on a wounded man,
      </l>
      <l n="854">
       Giving intolerable pain.
      </l>
      <l n="855">
       But now a better life began.
      </l>
      <l n="856">
       I felt the agony decrease
      </l>
      <l n="857">
       By slow degrees, then wholly cease,
      </l>
      <l n="858">
       Ending in perfect rest and peace!
      </l>
      <l n="859">
       It was not apathy, nor dulness,
      </l>
      <l n="860">
       That weighed and pressed upon my brain,
      </l>
      <l n="861">
       But the same passion I had given
      </l>
      <l n="862">
       To earth before, now turned to heaven
      </l>
      <l n="863">
       With all its overflowing fulness.
      </l>
      <l n="864">
       Alas! the world is full of peril!
      </l>
      <l n="865">
       The path that runs through the fairest meads,
      </l>
      <l n="866">
       On the sunniest side of the valley, leads
      </l>
      <l n="867">
       Into a region bleak and sterile!
      </l>
      <l n="868">
       Alike in the high-born and the lowly,
      </l>
      <l n="869">
       The will is feeble, and passion strong.
      </l>
      <l n="870">
       We cannot sever right from wrong;
      </l>
      <l n="871">
       Some falsehood mingles with all truth;
      </l>
      <l n="872">
       Nor is it strange the heart of youth
      </l>
      <l n="873">
       Should waver and comprehend but slowly
      </l>
      <l n="874">
       The things that are holy and unholy!
      </l>
      <l n="875">
       But in this sacred and calm retreat,
      </l>
      <l n="876">
       We are all well and safely shielded
      </l>
      <l n="877">
       From winds that blow, and waves that beat,
      </l>
      <l n="878">
       From the cold, and rain, and blighting heat,
      </l>
      <l n="879">
       To which the strongest hearts have yielded.
      </l>
      <l n="880">
       Here we stand as the Virgins Seven,
      </l>
      <l n="881">
       For our celestial bridegroom yearning;
      </l>
      <l n="882">
       Our hearts are lamps for ever burning,
      </l>
      <l n="883">
       With a steady and unwavering flame,
      </l>
      <l n="884">
       Pointing upward, for ever the same,
      </l>
      <l n="885">
       Steadily upward toward the Heaven!
      </l>
      <l n="886">
       The moon is hidden behind a cloud;
      </l>
      <l n="887">
       A sudden darkness fills the room,
      </l>
      <l n="888">
       And thy deep eyes, amid the gloom,
      </l>
      <l n="889">
       Shine like jewels in a shroud.
      </l>
      <l n="890">
       On the leaves is a sound of falling rain;

      <l n="891">
       A bird, awakened in its nest,
      </l>
      <l n="892">
       Gives a faint twitter of unrest,
      </l>
      <l n="893">
       Then smoothes its plumes and sleeps again.

      <l n="894">
       No other sounds than these I hear;
