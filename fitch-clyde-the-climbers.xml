     ACT I
    </head>
    <stage>
     A drawing-room at the Hunters', handsomely and artistically furnished. The woodwork and furniture are in the period of Louis XVI. The walls and furniture are covered with yellow brocade, and the curtains are of the same golden material. At the back are two large windows which give out on Fifth Avenue, opposite the Park, the trees of which are seen across the way. At Left is a double doorway, leading into the hall. At Right, opposite, is a door which leads to other rooms, and thence to other parts of the house. In the centre, at back, between the two windows, is the fireplace; on the mantel are two vases and a clock in dark blue ormolu. There is a white and gold piano on the Right side of the room. The room suggests much wealth, and that it has been done by a professional decorator; the personal note of taste is lacking .
    </stage>
    <stage>
     It is four o'clock in the afternoon. The shades of the windows are drawn down. There are rows and rows of camp-chairs filling the entire room .
    </stage>
    <stage>
     The curtain rises slowly. After a moment , Jordan , the butler, and Leonard , a footman, enter from the Left and begin to gather together and carry out the camp-chairs. They do this with very serious faces, and take great pains to step softly and to make no noise. They enter a second time for more chairs .

    <stage>
     They go out with the chairs and immediately reënter for more. They are followed in this time by a lady's maid , Tompson ; she is not a young woman. As she crosses the room she stoops and picks up a faded flower which has fallen from some emblem. She goes to the window at Right, and peeps out. She turns around and looks at the others. They all speak in subdued voices .

     <p>
      Take them last two chairs!
     </p>
    </sp>
    <stage>
     Leonard , with the chairs, follows Jordan out Left . Tompson hastily puts back a last armchair to its usual position in the room and goes out Right . Mrs. Hunter enters Left, followed by her three daughters , Blanche, Jessica , and Clara , and Master Sterling , who is a small, attractive child, five years of age. All are in the deepest conventional mourning , Mrs. Hunter in widow's weeds and Clara with a heavy, black chiffon veil; the Boy is also dressed in conventional mourning. As soon as they enter, all four women lift their veils . Mrs. Hunter is a well-preserved woman, with a pretty, rather foolish, and somewhat querulous face. Her figure is the latest mode . Blanche Sterling , her oldest daughter, is her antithesis, — a handsome, dignified woman, young, sincere, and showing, in her attitude to the others and in her own point of view, the warmth of a true, evenly-balanced nature . Jessica is a typical second child, — nice, good, self-effacing, sympathetic, unspoiled . Clara is her opposite, — spoiled, petulant, pretty, pert, and selfish .

Miss Godesby is a little slow, more assertive, sharper of tongue, more acutely intelligent, and equally smartly dressed.

     Christmas Eve; fourteen months later; the dining room of the Hunters' house, which is now lived in jointly by the Sterlings and Mrs. Hunter and her daughters. It is a dark wainscoted room, with curtains of crimson brocade. It is decorated with laurel roping, mistletoe, and holly, for Christmas. It is the end of a successful dinner party, fourteen happy and more or less congenial persons being seated at a table, as follows : Warden, Ruth, Mason, Clara, Trotter, Mrs. Hunter, Blanche, Sterling, Miss Sillerton, Mr. Godesby, Jessica, Doctor Steinhart , and Miss Godesby , The room is dark on all sides, only a subdued light being shed on the table by two large, full candelabra with red shaded candles. As the curtain rises the bare backs of the three women nearest the footlights gleam out white. Candied fruit and other sweetmeats are being passed by four men servants, including Jordan and Leonard .

      Oh, that present has almost been my death! Men are so hard to find things for! I had put in a gold pencil for his key chain, but to-night while we were eating our oysters, I saw him show a beauty that his mother had given him this morning! So I whispered to Jordan between the soup and fish to change Mr. Ryder's name to Mr. Trotter's stocking, and put Mr. Trotter's name on the one that had a cigarette case in it. I sneaked a message down to Dick on my dinner card — was it all right? — and he sent back word during the game that Trotter only smoked cigars; so before the ices were passed I shuffled Mr. Trotter's and Mr. Mason's names, — I'd given Mason the cigar case; — and just as Jordan signalled to me the

      It began fourteen months ago, after Ned Warden put me on my feet; I got a little ahead — why not get way ahead? There were plenty of men around me making their fortunes! I wanted to equal them — climb as high as they; it seemed easy enough for them, and luck had begun to come my way. We're all climbers of some sort in this world. I was a climber after wealth and everything it brings —

      Aunt Ruth's bonds and speculated — I made a hundred thousand in a week! I put back the bonds. But it had been so easy! I could see those bonds grinning at me through the iron side of the vault box. They seemed to smile and beckon, to
      beg
      me to take them out into the air again! They grew to be like living things to me, servants of mine to get me gold — and finally I determined to make one bigger coup than ever! I took Aunt Ruth's bonds out and all the money available in my trust, and put it
      all
      into this new company! It seemed so safe. I stood to be a prince among the richest! And, for a day or so, I've known nothing short of a miracle could save me from being wanted by the police! To-night I gave up even the miracle. That's all. It's no use saying I'm sorry.

You're not one of those catty creatures! You're a clever woman, and I don't doubt you can be a pretty

      What I say — I learned it then from a paper of my father's. I shouldn't have kept my knowledge to myself — I see that now; but I did, for your sake, not for love of you — the love went for good that day. But here, a moment ago, I realized
      <pb n="667"/>
      for the first time that my old friend
      did
      love me, love me with an ideal devotion the noblest woman in the world might be proud of! I didn't tell him then I loved him, but now I take this chance, I
      take it
      gladly
      before you! —
      forced by you!
      I tell him now, what perhaps he has already guessed, I love him with all my heart — I
      love him!
      I
      love him

     The following morning; at the Sterlings '; the library; a warm, livable, and lovable room, full of pictures, photographs, and books; mistletoe and holly decorate everywhere. In the bow-window at back there is a large bird-cage with half a dozen birds in it. The furniture is comfortable and heavily upholstered. At Left there is a fireplace with logs ready, but the fire is not lit. There a big table near the centre, full of magazines, illustrated papers, and books. A big arm-chair is beside the table, and other chairs conversationally close. There is a table near the door at Right, piled with Christmas gifts, still wrapped in white paper; they are tied with many colored ribbons and bunches of holly. There are doors Right and Left. After the curtain rises on an empty stage , Ruth enters quickly; while she has her buoyant manner, she is, of course, more serious than usual. She carries a bunch of fresh violets in her hand. She looks about the room with a sort of curiosity. She is waiting for some one to appear. She takes up a silver-framed photograph of her brother which stands on a table and speaks aloud to it .

      Blessedly happy! Our long silences in those days were not broken by an oath and a fling out of the room. Oh, the happiness it means to a wife to see it is hard for her husband to leave her in the morning, and to be taken so quickly — even roughly — into his arms at night that she knows he has been longing to come back to her. Nothing grew tame that first year. And at its end I climbed to the highest step I had reached yet, when you leaned over my bed and cried big man's tears, the first I'd ever seen you cry, and kissed me first, and then little Richard lying on my warm arm, and said, "God bless you, little mother."
