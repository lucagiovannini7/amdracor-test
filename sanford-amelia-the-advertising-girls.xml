    <stage>
     SCENE. — Garden scene, if it can be arranged, or use plain background. At R., back, an exit, and over it a large sign: "Summer Home for Working Girls." At L., back, another exit, concealed by a large clothes-horse, or a screen, opened out to represent an open book. This is to be covered with yellow cambric, dull side out, on one side of which is painted in large, black letters: "Hopper's New Magazine," and on the other side: "Established B. C. 9843." Stand this in such a way as to open away from the audience. It will thus conceal the entrance, and actors coming in from there will look as though they stepped out of a large book. At centre of stage, at back, is a good-sized table, with chair at each side. At R. and L. of stage, are rustic chairs, potted plants, etc. Enter BICYCLE GIRL, L., from book, with wheel. Takes it R.; throws herself down wearily in chair , R. F. Addresses audience .

I am the Girl Who Did and she is the Girl Who Didn't. They always show off poor sis with a wretched skirt-braid forever tripping her up, while I stand in such a priggish attitude, like this.

      I have a plan for our emancipation, at least for a time, from this eternal round of advertising, and I believe we can get a lovely long rest. We could have this place to ourselves all the year around, if we could only scare people away, and I believe I know how to do it.

      By tearing down that sign and putting up another: "Society for the Propagation of Microbes." You know, if there's anything people fear especially, it's a microbe, and they will all keep away when they read the sign. And why not make a bonfire of all the things which have wearied us so long? Also, we can add the old magazine, to make a good blaze? Then our emancipation will be complete.

      To clean things with a jolly brown rag, and put them on
                                            the shelf.
