     Was first produced at a benefit performance, at the Bijou Theatre, Boston, on the evening of January 18, 1898. On this occasion, "Karen" was played by Miss Minnie Dupree; "Alec" by Mr. Horace Lewis; and "Mrs. Pennypacker" by Miss Kate Ryan.
    </p>
    <p>
     The scene is Alec McLaren's lodging room, in Mrs. Pennypacker's house. The time is midnight of a stormy November night.

    The scene is a large, bare room in a city lodging-house. A fire is burning on hearth, R. C. A couch is drawn up before it with a pillow or two covered in bright chintz, and a dilapidated buffalo robe thrown over it. A table, C., is littered with books, newspapers, pipes, etc. A battered arm-chair stands beside it. Other chairs in various stages of disrepair stand about the room. There is a wall-cupboard, with doors left, back. At the left, back, a large, low window with curtain half drawn on its string. The walls are ornamented with rough sketches, pictures from illustrated papers, etc., unframed; a pair of gloves and of foils; pipe rack, etc. On a row of hooks, back, left, hang various fancy costumes, odd hats, etc. A door, L. 4. As the curtain rises the wind is heard shrieking without; the door is pushed open and Mrs. Pennypacker, a thin, gaudily-dressed Cockney, enters. She carries a candle. She is speaking to some one on the stairs without .

That's wot McLaren's been a-doin', an' 'e hall the time a character hactor fit to kill! Character! Anybody could see it with 'arf a heye, — hanybody but a manager! Managers! Faugh! If managers 'adn't been a set o'bloomin' fools, wouldn't I 'a 'ad my whack at Juliet, any day these forty years? Just because McLaren's got
