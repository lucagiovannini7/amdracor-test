      The fast falling snow beats heavily against the casement window. A woman is seated before the cheerful fire. She holds something in her hands. Her eyes have a tender look in them. This something awakens pleasant memories. Her lips are parted in a smile. What can it be? A book? No. A beautiful flower, perhaps, whose fragrance makes glad the heart of the woman? No. What can it be?

      A letter for Nan, and in a man's handwriting. From whom can it be? I should like to know. Her appointment as teacher, perhaps. It is not closely sealed.

      No, much as I would like to read it, I will not stoop to so base an act. Nan a teacher! She would leave here, and become independent. She has made a secret of this. The idea of taking such a step without consulting us! I will have a secret, too, Miss Nan, just long enough to make it too late for your appointment. You will find it isn't wise to have secrets from me.

      Wait, until I tell you. Unknown to us, Nan has passed the examinations and has received an appointment as teacher. A secret plotting going on beneath our very eyes. I intend to give the letter to Nan when it is too late for the appointment this year.

      Eleanor, you will forgive me for this masquerading, but I wished to know who would love me for myself. My property was not lost through speculations; and as I wished to make some one my heir, I took this means.

      I thought to find one by my deception, but my discovery proved richer than I dared hope. Nan, who because she knew what loneliness was, gave me all that she possessed.

May their noble work continue: helping the needy "In His name"; giving because it is good to give; and may every young woman who seeks to live an honest, upright life find the "Open Sesame" to peace and happiness in becoming truly, a King's Daughter.
