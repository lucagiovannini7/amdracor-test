      I could almost repent that nature had not
      left me in the insignificance of my birth — what right had the
      son of a hard-working Yorkshire coal-owner to flaunt it at
      Eton and Oxford, and all because my mother, before my birth,
      dreamed of a woolsack, and so would call me Littleton —
      and yet, while my suppers and stable were declared unique
      — when tufted lordlings exchanged christian names with me
      — I thought — ha! — I see my error — mistook my money for
      myself — why was I given so keen a sense for enjoyment,
      and so limited a power of gratifying it?

      Reproach, nay, not so — Nature gave him a great

      than I, and so he had all that wealth could lavish on him —
      <pb n="12"/>
      I didn't grudge it him — he fed from the silver plate, I from
      the wooden platter — I cared nuaw't for that; but at his grand
      school, why did he find the houses of my lord this, and marquis
      that, more welcome than his own home. I don't reproach,
      mind — but — but when our mother died I stood alone by her —
      and her last breath prayed for him. I wasn't jealous, minister,
      but, in my father's will, the part that gave me my inheritance
      was writ in the hard hand of a lawyer's clerk, while the gift to
      Littleton, with a blessing, was penned by the trembling fingers
      of my father, and blotted wi' his tears. I've tried to hate him.
