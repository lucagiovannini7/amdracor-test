    He that is always wise is no Blockhead; nor does it follow, that he who is not always wise is a Blockhead. — A Blockhead will scarely be claimed by any body in the universe — consequently you will find no one to own the heads I have described; of course you can be in no danger of a claimant, who will call you to an account for meddling with his head. — Yet Blockheads sometimes govern, and are governed, though not all times in their proper persons — a Deputy does the business best who is no Blockhead, and it please you if he does his own business under a Blockhead's nomination. — Contractors are no Blockheads, though Contractees often are. — It is strange there should be such a difference between Buyer and Buyee. — Who is in the wrong? No matter who — he is a Blockhead that owns it. Ergo, A wise man may be a Blockhead if he enters his claim to any of the heads in this petit piece.

       Old wigs, gentlemen! short wigs!
       bobbs! grizzles! tyes, and no tyes!
       Pick and chase, the price is fix'd. — This
       is a simple head of hair, not indebted to
       nature for a curl; the wearer was suspected
       of less courage than he possessed; he
       was provident in his principles, and
       sought for an independance.
      </p>
      <p>
       This head had a great deal of good-nature,
       and wore it upon all occasions;
       but at last, influenced by the habit of the
       times, resolved on a change.
      </p>
      <p>
       This wig cover'd the head of a lawyer
       — the tyes nearly gone; his principles
       induced him to turn his back on his best
       friends.

       — Oh! cursed hour that first betray'd
       my heart — the fatal chains were
       then in embiyo, but now, alas! they're
       forg'd. — Behold these Gaulic fetters,
       <stage>
        (pauses.)
       </stage>
       — The sad tear, impal'd in overwhelming
       grief, has stopp'd it's course,
       and I'm denied relief.

    FINIS.
                    
                    
                        The Author to the Door-Keeper
                            of the Theatre.
When Fancy's on the wing, and takes her flight,
She'll steal your picture, whether wrong or right.
You're now appriz'd, nor think my muse to blame,
She shews each feature, yet conceals your name.
The picture's striking, who can fail to guess
The awkward portrait in a lively dress.
The features fit, tho' hundreds may oppose,
And swear 'tis not your head, or eyes, or nose.
Your chief supporters daub me with their wit,
Yet all shall own the likeness is well hit.

So , Sir, you say the Blockheads
                            shall not appear on your Theatre. — Strange, indeed! You have only read
                            the title page, and yet venture to guess at the whole of the business. I
                            give you my word not a single auditor can possibly discover a line in
                            the features of any of my Blockheads, that conveys the most distant hint
                            at your head. You oblige me to confess, I never entertained a  thought of your being a conjuror! But you have gone a great way to
                            impress such a conclusion on my mind, by venturing to guess at the whole
                            of the piece from the title. You have reconsidered the business, and
                            find it is not in your power, on account of your own productions, to
                            exhibit the Blockheads. If the old veterans have been discharged without
                            assigning a reason, surely I may think myself fortunate in having
                            extorted two in support of my expulsion; but still
                            the Blockheads shall appear, so shall the sequel, together with the
                            pigmies and anti-pigmies. The heads are nearly ready for exhibition; the
                            moment I can compleat them, you shall have the honor of appearing the
                            first of the groupe, if you will condescend to stand still whilst I draw
                            your picture; if not, I'll take it flying. But should you be at a loss
                            to distinguish one Blockhead from another, the Editor may assist you
                            with a hint or two for your  instruction. You cannot be at a
                            loss for the definition of a Blockhead; but, to assist your memory — he
                            has no brains, no argument can penetrate beyond the surface — The
                            surface is a mere block that surely will never be own'd, though the
                            likeness may provoke risibility in the by-standers. For the present I
                            drop the curtain, that the next scene may appear with more lusture, in
                            which I have the pleasure to assure you, no pains shall be spared to
                            give a striking likeness; and
                        I am,  Your most devoted servant, 
                            The AUTHOR.
                        Middle Row, New York.
